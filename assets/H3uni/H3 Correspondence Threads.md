Cool inquiry mate!   
  
Anthony previously framed the VSM as a pentad in the esystems course lie this:  

-   Purpose  
-   Intelligence  
-   Operations  
-   Coordination Task  
-   Resourcing  

I recognise your asking about the tetrad so these terms don't fit; however the terms above can probably be used to check semantic integrity in some way. Given the theory we know that operations will sit directly in the middle of the tetrad which we might tentatively label purpose, intelligence, task and resources to help us figure some things out.

Here's a go at based on the diagram you shared:  

-   **Ideal** :: Governance and decision making integrity  
-   **Ground** :: Process level / System one  
-   **Directive** :: Regulation and tactical planning  
-   **Instrumental** :: Marketing, development and research  

Assumedly these need to change in flavour to become more abstract as we're working backwards from the pentad - which is perhaps where the tetradic edges begin to play a part? I guess looking at my attempt above and your follow up email, we both see system four as instrumental means. I would imagine that the edges are verbs rather than nouns but am uncertain.  

Cheers, Beer(s) and Bennet!

Hi John,

I have been sleeping on your question (far too complicated to tackle when ‘awake’!) as the only way I could engage an improbability drive, and this where I tentatively find myself.

VSM is an implicate dynamic pattern for any viable system in action at any scale.

The Tetrad is an implicate dynamic field of action for any activity as it is happening.

Both are present, along with other implicate dynamic patterns, in any explicate system or ecology we choose to look at.

Tentative postulation:

The pattern we actually discern at any time depends upon the perspective we adopt for the purpose of our enquiry – the observer/the act of observation illuminates the pattern from all the background information.

The hidden relationships among any of these different patterns become matters of discernment by an observer, according to the observer’s state of mind and capacity for envisioning them in presence – i.e. in their seven (?) dimensions of time.

(In this way the universe opens to our investigations and can show us the variety wholes we are looking for/able to discover…)

Tentative implicate speculation:

If each node of the Tetrad is viable ‘on its own’ (i.e. within the frame in which it is being observed), then each has its VSM pattern, according to its role. The inter-node connections relate as inter-VSM connections from this perspective.

What is the VSM of a whole Tetrad? Here again, each element, 1-5, of the tetradic VSM is a field of action within the whole implicate VSM, and therefore has its tetradic aspects embedded in it.

The two patterns become inter-operable, and can be seen from either perspective, but escape a defined analytical comparison. (I am picturing them rather as if two different holograms had a common substrate?)

What do you think?
