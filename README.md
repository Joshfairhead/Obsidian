# Obsidian Vault

**What is this?**
- This is my Obsidian vault for public consumption. 
- I have private directories as well which are excluded vith Git.
- The vault is intentionally structured to cover everything I need to necessary and sufficient degrees
- I'll list ignored folders, use them as ideas for your own vault, or just ignore the things that dont exist on my github.

**The three primary structures are the modal attractors of:**
- Immanent
- Omnicient
- Trancendental

**The Immanent is for things in the present moment. it has the following folders:**
- CallNotes (Scribbles while on a call)
- DailyNotes (the anchor of my day)
- Personal (all notes not for public consumption, PII etc)
- R3solution (an in process semantics project)
- Workbench (where every new note lands)

**The Omnicient is for things characteristic of information or intelligance. It has the following folders:**
- Artifacts Entropy (things that have been created but have gone stale)
- Computer Sci (resources related to computer science and technology)
- Entities (people and organisations; find the others!)
- Monad forrest (big notes on a damain)
- Monad saplings (medium notes on a domain)
- Manad seeds (small notes on a domain)

**Trancendental is for evergreen content, it has the following folders:**
- Evergreen forrest (completed work that won't age)
- Evergreen saplings (maturing work that won't age)
- Evergreen seeds (the start of work that wont age)

Inside the DailyNotes folder I have two notes: 
- Drum (a daily schedule for tracking my capacity)
- Buffer (chunks of things I can fill time with, tasks I dont wan't distracting me)

Templates for DailyNotes can be found in the assets folder. If were talking about theory of constraints, the daily note acts as the rope.

### How to use:
- Download Obsidian or other graph explorer that recognises markdown
- Download the contents of this vault and open it
	- You can do this via github either via zipfile or with a git pull; just click the green button top right for both these options

### Conclusion
Now you know the structure of my digital brain. May it's memes spread. Ad Astra and To The Cosmos!
