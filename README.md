# Obsidian Vault

**What is this?**
- This is my Obsidian vault for public consumption. 
- I have private directories as well which are excluded vith Git.
- The vault is intentionally structured to cover everything I need to necessary and sufficient degrees
- I'll list ignored folders, use them as ideas for your own vault, or just ignore the things that dont exist on my github.

**The three primary structures are the modal attractors of:**
- Immanent
- Omnicient
- Trancendental

**The Immanent is for things in the present moment. it has the following folders:**
- CallNotes (Scribbles while on a call)
- DailyNotes (the anchor of my day)
- Personal (all notes not for public consumption, PII etc)
- Systematic ConstruKction (an in process semantics project)
- Workbench (where every new note lands)

**The Omnicient is for things characteristic of information or intelligance. It has the following folders:**
- Artifacts Entropy (things that have been created but have gone stale)
- Computer Sci (resources related to computer science and technology)
- Entities (people and organisations; find the others!)
- Monad forrest (big notes on a damain)
- Monad saplings (medium notes on a domain)
- Manad seeds (small notes on a domain)


**Trancendental is for evergreen notes, it has the following folders:**
- Evergreen forrest (completed work that won't age)
- Evergreen saplings (maturing work that won't age)
- Evergreen seeds (the start of work that wont age)

### Conclusion
Now you know the structure of my digital brain. May it's memes spread.
