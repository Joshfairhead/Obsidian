# Follow the breath

Follow the breath. That is to say, notice how the states of consciousness modulate according to the breath. Try combining practices and experimenting while noting the results; for instance the [[Three, six nine meditation]] and the depth of inhale.

[[Associative, Perceptual, Creative]]

## Experimental efforts
Symmetry (continuity? meaning?):
- Symmetric breathing feels akin to finding the ground. (values?)
- Asymetric breathing feels akin to conjuring abstractions. (purpose?)

Depth:
- Shallow breathing
- Deep breathing

Speed:
- Fast breathing
- Slow breathing

Slow deep symetrical breathing feels akin to physical healing.
