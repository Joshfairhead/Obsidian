# The Essence of Complimentarity
[[Hypothesis]] [[Logic]]

Complementarity autonyms represent a pair of symetric operators.
Graded autonyms are asymetric and ma implicitly involve a third state

**Complementary autonyms**
Subjective | Objective 
Equal | Opposite
And | Or

**Graded autonyms**
Equal | Distinct

Complementary autonyms are assumed to be convertable into symmetric threeness. This `fundemental triplication` takes only one form; a set of three terms that correspond to and describe either term within the symetrical dyads.

**Symmetric scale shift example**
Subjective | Objective 
Immannent | Omnicient | Trancendental
Being | Existance | Reality

**Symmetric scale shift long form**
Subjective | Objective 
- **Subjective** 
 	- Immanent | Omnicient | Trancendental 
 	- Being | Existance | Reality
- **Objective** 
	- Immanent | Omnicient | Trancendental
	- Being | Existance | Reality

%% This may be confirmation bias as it simply describes Landrys logic. It seems to work with alternative examples such as below. Make sure to examine them and [[Measure Semantic Delta]] for yourself though%%

## Experiments
**Symmetric scale shift test**
Relationships
Equal | Opposite 
Correspondence | Contiguity | Compresence 

**Symmetric scale shift test**
Relationships
And | !Not
Correspondence | Contiguity | Compresence
%% Note: the same triplication seems to roughly correspond to two different attractors or a `symetric duplication` that can be normalized to the polarity of subjective/objective. [[Measure Semantic Delta]]%%

%% Its assumed that asymmetric dyads will lead to asymetric triplications (two pairs of three), but an effort to reconcile them into a `fundamental triplication` has not been made so neither can any claims%%
