# Extitutionality

**Extitutions** according to Tony Lai are about:
- Identity %% Identity in the active and [[Immanent]] form is a sense of self (??) %%
- Relationship 

**Identity triad**
3: Function
6: Being
9: Will

or

3: Doing
6: Becoming
9: Being

**Relationships triad**
3: Correspondence
6: Contiguity
9: Copresence

Prioritising the [[Immanent]] we derrive the terms Function (or Doing) and Correspondence (active fit over time). We can break this up into triads to explain the dynamic qualities, but to gain resolution it makes sense to shift up a system to Tetradic structures whos quality is a field of action.

**Doing Triad**
3: Sense
6: Perception
9: Conception

or

3: Probe
6: Sense
9: Respond

**Correspondence triad**
3: Logic
6: Rhetoric
9: Grammar

**Function/Doing Tetrad**
**Correspondence Tetrad**
