# Open Magick
Magic is synonomyous with secrets, whether we know it or not we go about unintentionally casting spells on eachother everyday. Open Magick considers the situation unavoidable due to the symbols (letters, words, pictures, models, frameworks) we use to convey meaning and communicate.

Open Magik acknowleges this hypnotising effect of symbols and so it challenges us to discern and determine the spells enchanting us, while disclosing our methods and intentions while enchanting others. 

Open Magick is thus about sharing spells, not keeping secrets. 

Abdoctrination, not indoctrination.
