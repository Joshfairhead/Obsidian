# Memes Through the Ages

Memes -> Propaganda -> Territorialisation

Memes act an audience scoping function with modal attractors for:
- General audiences (general values) / broadcast
- Specific audiences (specific values) / narrowcast

They are thus used to culturally define the in/out group boundaries. 

1:1 meme = a Google whack / personal connection. 

Memes are a carrier wave for:
Signalling in general
Irony -> meta-irony -> post-irony
Affirmations (self-hypnosis, or hypnosis of others)
Binary propositions?
Mental territorialisation
Provoking thought - philosoraptor

Memetics have a `fitness` model of replicibility (at least according to Dawkins original definition). In the modern age this replicability is algorithmically skewed by the platforms behaviour models. Change the network structure or algorithm (context), change the replication qualities (content) [[AlgoSov]].

Right now memes are sub-cultural. They are products that keep people on platforms. If you are putting out propaganda on your own behalf - especially if your cause is political - then capitalism has trancended your activity. The only way out is through the dark forrest.
