# Find peace in a warzone

Maybe don't look for a warzone, but if you come across an unavoidable situation like such, try to find peace in it.  
  
Perhaps this is what everyone is doing, but we're not very good at it. Finding peace in a warzone is finding peace in the present moment. If you can't do this but at least try, then in may be a "one rep max" kind of situation; the stressor will increase your capacity. 
  
In other thoughts, I ponder if peace is the reconciling force between commerce and correspondence?
