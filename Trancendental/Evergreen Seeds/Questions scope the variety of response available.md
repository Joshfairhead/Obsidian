# Questions scope the variety of response available

When you ask a question, the type of question permits degrees of freedom. Closed questions tend towards boolean answers, open questions create a space of affordances. A more open the question increases the scope of possible answers. A closed question constrains the variety of possible answers. Open quesions are general, while closed questions are more specific and granular. Questions thus work at levels of scale.

A directed question `demands` a response from the receiver, which may also create a greater feeling of `closeness`. This can be weaponized as `interrogation` too. 

the disclosure of the questions in my mind rather than directing a question. I've felt this leading to more open explorations in voice-based dialog, but I see now it can also produce the opposite effect in text-based dialog (especially around sensitive topics).
