# Questions scope the variety of response available

When we ask a question the form of question permits degrees of freedom. Closed questions tend towards boolean answers, open questions create a space of affordances. A more open the question increases the scope of possible answers. A closed question constrains the variety of possible answers. Open quesions are general, while closed questions are more specific and granular. Questions thus work at levels of scale.

A directed question `demands` a response from the receiver, which may also create a greater feeling of `closeness`. However, this can be weaponized as `interrogation`.  Perhaps its worthwhile disclosing questions in ones mind rather than directing a question. This may lead to more open explorations in voice-based dialog, but it may also produce the opposite effect in text-based dialog (especially around sensitive topics).
