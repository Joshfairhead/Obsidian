# Questions scope the variety of response available

When you ask a question, the type of question permits degrees of freedom. Closed questions tend towards boolean answers, open questions create a space of affordances. A more open the question increases the scope of possible answers. A closed question constrains the variety of possible answers. Open quesions are general, while closed questions are more specific and granular. Questions thus work at levels of scale.
