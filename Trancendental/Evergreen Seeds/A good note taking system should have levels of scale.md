# A good note taking system should have levels of scale

In [[Take notes to capture insight]] I posit that there are levels to a note taking system. This is because "intelligance" is essentially raw "data" or "information", while "concepts" or "insights" are at a higher level. I'm specifically thinking about a book I started quite some time ago called "Data Warehousing"; which posited that there is a hieracrhy of: data > information > knowlege > wisdom. 

This specific hierarchy is one particular ontology, and others can be used, but its illustritive of my point: "insight" (or "knowlege") is at a higher level than "data" or information.
