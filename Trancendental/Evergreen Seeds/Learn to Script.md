# Learn to Script

Obsidian includes a lot of useful plugins; namely the daily notes and calandar plugin. Use these for project management by building up daily structures with a template and then automate their population through scripting.

Events and tasks that happen in the future create noise if kept on a daily note, instead place these on calandar days. This gets them out of the field of action, but also means they are invisable until immenent - which is not optimal. Use scripts to scrape the calandar and log the closest ones at the end of each daily note.
