# The Essence of Complimentarity
[[Hypothesis]] [[Logic]]

Complementarity represents a pair of operators.
Such operators can be symmetrical or asymetrical. 

**Symetric examples**
Subjective | Objective 
Equal | Opposite
And | Or

**Asymmetric example**
Equal | Distinct

When a dyad takes symmetric form, in that it is self canceling, it's assumed that its terms can be transformed into symmetric threeness. This `fundemental triplication` takes only one form; a set of three terms that correspond to and describe either term within the symetrical dyads.

**Symmetric scale shift example**
Subjective | Objective 
Immannent | Omnicient | Trancendental
Being | Existance | Reality

**Symmetric scale shift long form**
Subjective | Objective 
- **Subjective** 
 	- Immanent | Omnicient | Trancendental 
 	- Being | Existance | Reality
- **Objective** 
	- Immanent | Omnicient | Trancendental
	- Being | Existance | Reality

%% This may be confirmation bias as it simply describes Landrys logic. It seems to work with alternative examples such as below but examine them and [[Measure semantic delta]] for yourself%%

## Experiments
**Symmetric scale shift test**
Equal | Opposite 
Correspondence | Contiguity | Compresence 

**Symmetric scale shift test**
And | !Not
Correspondence | Contiguity | Compresence
%% Note: the same triplication seems to roughly correspond to  two different attractors or a `symetric duplication` that can be normalized to the polarity of subjective/objective. [[Measure semantic delta]]%%

%% Its assumed that asymmetric dyads will lead to asymetric triplications (two pairs of three), but an effort to reconcile them into a `fundamental triplication` has not been made so neither can any claims%%
