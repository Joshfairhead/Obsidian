# A ship at sea gathers no barnicals

When you remain still for long things attach themselves to you. When you have a house you accumulate `stuff`. Things that bind to you like barnicals on a rock. They might be possessions, pets or people. These are not bad things, they are just attachments and they accumulate. If one always moves briskly, then the opposite will be true and one may find themself starving for attachment... anchors from which to moor themselves and perhaps gather a few barnicals.
