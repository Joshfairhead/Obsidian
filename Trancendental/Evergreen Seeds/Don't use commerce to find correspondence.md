# Don't use commerce to find correspondence

Commerce is a transactional interaction of some form; buying and selling through speech acts for example. Correspondence is a good fit.  
  
By spending social capital - life force - on commerce, one may end up broke with only merchants around them. If we let correspondence slowly emerge across the interactions of many people, we might save the precious moments to become wealthy.
