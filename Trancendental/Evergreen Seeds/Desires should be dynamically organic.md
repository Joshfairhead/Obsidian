# Desires should be dynamically organic

I like my desires to arise organically, rather than being put there by someone else. I'd rather meet a situation that I'm unprepared for than to anticipate that I'll need a particular item (e.g. going to the beach > not owning swimming shorts = ğŸš« ).  
  
Of course there is a dynamic between needs and wants, as I'd like to anticipate major desires like water in a desert; but a lot of wants can be disregarded.
