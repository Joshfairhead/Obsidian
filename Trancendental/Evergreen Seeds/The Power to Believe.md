# The Power to Believe
[[Memetics]]
- Imagination is the instantiation of an image in the mind
- Symbols and glyphs are ambiguous images conjured by others
- We ask why, seeking explanations from those who created them
- This may be the birth of word propaganda a neutral term originating with the meanng "to spread" or "to propagate".
- Memes are the definition of propaganda. Their express purpose is to reproduce. <<{??}
- The replication of a meme is shaped by the context or medium 		which carries it. 
- This context acting like a carrier wave is not unbiased, it is algorythmically skewed. 
- This is significant because if you control the medium you control the message. The new political parties are big tech and those who shape the network topology decide how messages propagate. 
- This is truely sorcrery; so what does Open sourcery look like? An acknowlegement that all words, symbols, glyphs and meme are hypnosis? [[Open Magick]]
- Why would that matter? Because memes denote territories. 
	- You most apparently see parallels in national propaganda. 
	-  They noetically territorialise your mind. This can have both desirable and undesirable effects.
