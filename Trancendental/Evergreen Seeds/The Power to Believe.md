[[Memetics]]
- Imagination is the instantiation of an image in the mind
- Symbols and glyphs are ambiguous images conjured by others
- We ask why, seeking explanations from those who created them
- This may be the birth of the word propaganda a neutral term originating with the meanng "to spread" or "to propagate".
- Memes are the definition of propaganda. Their express purpose is to reproduce. 
- The replication of a meme is shaped by the context or medium 		which carries it. 
- This context acting like a carrier wave is not unbiased, it is algorythmically skewed. This is significant because if you control the medium you control the message. The new political parties are those who shape the network topology, essentially deciding how messages propagate. [[AlgoSov]]
- Memes denote territory (just like project names). Parallels can be seen in the propaganda used to indoctrinate masses into upholding the idea of national boraders. This is a form of `noetic territorialisation`, leading to real territorialisation.
	- The illusion of territories seem necessary on at least some leves because much of society runs on trancendental psychology. 
		- You can see it on the macro level where we often undiscerningly beg to be hypnotized at churches, sports events, movie theatres and through group identities like company names ect. [[The Society of the Spectacle]]
		- On the mirco level, we communicate through symbols, words, letters and sentances which enchant and animate our inner worlds with imagery and thought (your reading a page of them now right?).[[The Society of the Spectacle]]
	- Once a symbol or symbol system enchantes its audience, they go on to articulating a culture - again through replicating symbols.
		- Given the will, one might write a taxonomy of meme types, though they likely exist - but its probably easier to think in terms of provinance and intention. 	
		- General memes have greater `extensionality` while specific memes have greater `intensionality`. These symbols and spells cover breath and depth of the audience. The in/out group boundaries.
		- In this way it might be said that memes are a form of diagrammatic reasoning.

	
	- Assuming communication is a case of "I meme, therefore I am" and they are but the transmission of ideas. We can ask the significance of its message? Is it genuinly bringing joy to the world? Is it positive sum? 

	- In the digital landscape, algorythm and network structure denotes replication affordances (aka audience).
