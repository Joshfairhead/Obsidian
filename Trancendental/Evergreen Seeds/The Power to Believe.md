[[Memetics]]
- Imagination is the instantiation of an image in the mind
- Symbols and glyphs are ambiguous images conjured by others
- We ask why, seeking explanations from those who created them
- This may be the birth of the word propaganda a neutral term originating with the meanng "to spread" or "to propagate".
- Memes are the definition of propaganda. Their express purpose is to reproduce. 
- The replication of a meme is shaped by the context or medium 		which carries it. 
- This context acting like a carrier wave is not unbiased, it is algorythmically skewed. This is significant because if you control the medium you control the message. The new political parties are those who shape the network topology, essentially deciding how messages propagate. [[AlgoSov]]
- Memes denote territory (just like project names). Parallels can be seen in the propaganda used to indoctrinate masses into upholding the idea of national boraders. This is a form of `noetic territorialisation`, leading to real territorialisation.
	- The illusion of territories seem necessary however; much of society runs on trancendental to be hypnotized how else do you bridge with the present tense and interface with the masses undecerningly beg to be hypnotised? [[The Society of the Spectacle]]
	- Once an audience has been reached, this audience articulates their cultural boundaries (in multiple dimensions) through symbol.
	- One might write a taxonomy of meme types - and they likely exist - but its probably easier to think in terms of provinance and intention. 
	- It might be said that memes are a form of diagrammatic reasoning; general memes have greater `extensionality` while specific memes have greater `intensionality`. These symbols and spells cover breath and depth of the audience. The in/out group boundaries.
	- Assuming existance is a case of "I meme, therefore I am" and they are but another form of communication. then we can ask the significance of its message? Is it genuinly bringing joy to the world? Is it positive sum? 



	- In the digital landscape, algorythm and network structure denotes replication affordances (aka audience).

- How can memes be used with measure and appropriation?
