# The paranoid android

This is a thank you note. 

I wanted to express my grattitude for Sunday; an example of your bravery that kindly shines light into dark places - blind assumptions I sometimes hold about the world that are good to release. Your responses were such good medicine!

This story starts on an assumption that our common perception of Sunday night was that it was a great evening but the sleeping arrangement didn't work so well for either of us. Timing wise it would have made more sense if I'd left about the time I decided to have a smoke. What I appreciate most are the snippets of interactions that night.

The first comment I appreciated was "hmmmm you smell nice" while coming back in; these words reflected light onto a smokey shadow thats pretty good for me to see. These welcoming invitations flat out refuted a shame complex I'll call the "paranoid smoker"; a passennger who perpetuates an anti-triangle of alone, bad and different in my life by being overly mindful/cerebral - at moments when mind should probably not be present! 

This guy came back in, laid down and became overly conciencous of being disruptive to your sleep, which in turn didn't help things.
