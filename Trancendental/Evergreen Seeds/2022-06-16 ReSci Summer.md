# 2022-06-16 Thursday ReSci Summer

Hello wodl, 

Having resigned from the Regen Foundation at the start of this week I find myself ready to hitchhike the Cosmos. ReFi Spring was great but now the seasons changing it feels like a new meme is emerging; ReSci summer!

### What is ReSci?
Good question; a supercomputer may dwell on it for thousands of years and is likely to return the answer of 42. In all seriousness though, before we can go further with "what is ReSci" we need to examine our priors. I'm about to commit heresy by questioning a western deity... "What is Science?" 

Ahhh moloch, whos blood is tears and flesh is steel... 

But honestly though - have you ever thought about it? What does the word 'science' even mean? What kind of 'science' are we talking about? Who authored your preferred definition? What gives that legitimacy? 

Damn, many will have opinions but you'll probably notice that this is really thorny stuff. In my cosmological search I've discovered that there are a few who seem to have grocked it's essence like Thomas Khun and other free radicals: 

> Science is a methodology paired with a community of practice. Thats all.

Yes, we were all taught about the Baconian method in school and yes its still relevant because it's useful in decribing the physical world but push it to its limits with notions like time and uncertainty and it ends up pretty stuck. We will need something of much greater explanitory power to take us into the future. I'm hoping this will be what ReSci becomes though I alone can only speculate of course.

### Methodology
When you start to think about and question methodologies, you very quickly end up in the realm of metaphysics; a frame consisting of the domains of ontology (being) and epistemology (knowing). However - like scientism, there are many flavours of metaphysics and most of them taste just as theistic... Which 'truth' should you believe? 

The answer to that one is whichever you want to believe, but one of the prerequisites of real science is that it doesn't rely on arbitrary beliefs to substantiate "truth" - instead it's an empercial undertaking. So in order to derrive a new scientific paradigm, we have to update our metaphysical paridigm as well - crikey; it's turtles all the way down! 

How do we discern if a metaphysics is bullshit? Most of the time you gotta just buy the ticket and take the ride to find out. Empericism is thus at the heart of all science. So, can we derrive an emperical metaphysics? Something built from the ground up and reaching as far as to encompass the whole cosmos? Perhaps. 

It's really tricky work but it may be possible. Aristotle did a pretty good job a couple of mliennea ago but perhaps needs updating at this point. As Khun observed, Aristotles methods seem pretty foreign compared to todays standards but yet they worked and without them we wouldn't be were we are today. How was he doing things? 

Well, there are the seven liberal arts comprising of the Trivium and the Quadrivium. These are pretty interesting in themselves but you really gotta ask about the frame behind these constructs; why three or four? I've not personally found a direct answer from Aristotle; though I have had the luck to stumble into the work of John Bennet who updates and makes sense of these questions by building his metaphysics from a modern emperical grounding! 

This is pretty far out though, lets ground things a bit. Assuming we have an adequite metaphysics of some variety; we should be abe to instantiate new scientific methodologies in their representative domains. These would be non-arbitrary as well.

Have we found the holy grail then? Perhaps - to my underdeveloped reasoning it seems that he may well have cracked the clockwork though it seems more probable that this work increases our understanding of the cosmos, and can probably be used to increase our intentionality as well... At this stage I can only suggest that you buy your own tickets!
