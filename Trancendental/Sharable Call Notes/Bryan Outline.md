# Bryan Outline

-  Sees proof of regeneration as a scheme for land reform via tokenisation
- There is hazard potential in the incentives in that they can pre-degrade the land
- Unlocking value by repricing land; powerful if loans based
	- Regenerators can then acquire more land
	- Selling asset backed commodities back to the bank
- Does this warp the game and create a race to the top?
	- Does this potential value just get priced into the land?
	- Depends if sitting on land is easier/more valuable
- Whats the fundemental to solve for?
	- Carbon sinking
	- Soil regeneration
	- Food security
	- Agency over basics
	- Stopping deforestation
	- Make farming profitable 
	- All the above and more?
		- Probably; you need all the pieces to work holistically!
- Whats clear is that urban growing is unprofitable because of speculation driving land price
	- Why cut down forrests for soy?
	- Why plant fields of lettuice or soy in the first place?
	- Food scarcity is generally about mal distribution (long tail?)
	- Regeneration needs to be more profitable
		- Tokenomics can warp this via co-benefits
- Is this just a scheme to unlock tranches of capital agains a new metric?
	- Belief credits vs behavioural change
	- Post hoc reward for good behaviour?
		- People only buy the credits to meet obligations
		- Cap and trade systems
		- Doesn't function without mandated caps but regulation sucks
			- Becomes a hybrid of base credits (tokens) and cap and trade (gov)
				- Works but only after sign up, shoddy hacky baselines
			- Has the side effect of pricing people out of land 
				- Doesn't see a path of credits getting seperated from land (Co-benefits??)
				- Still have to compete against industrial ag
				- Especially dangerous if one has privilaged access to capital based on promises (forwards)
		- Short termist industrial ag needs to be made unprofitable
			- Only works when we hit rock bottom and theres a scarcity of efficiency upgrades
				- Efficiency upgrades get rewarded by accounting methods
					- Net present value
					- Costs saved by getting over the upfront capital hurdle help finance other improvements
					- Mathmatic seperation (qualitive accounting) is needed
			- Ecosystem services only solves for internalisation of costs, which is only half the battle
				- Shouldnt be represented as costs, instead an investment into wealth
			- Economic exchange lacks sufficient embedding
				- Only conveys info on whats available and price
				- Needs to be augmented with other information streams and tied to human behaviour (if using number)
				- POR requires tokens being minted out of thin air, fungibility and acceptance. (Praxis based methods -> meta token??)
