# Bryans thoughts on Regen

- Not sure if I've got this right.. but it strikes me that Regen network is essentially a schema for land reform - by repricing the value of the land (or its services) and depending on whether that tokenized 'value' in accounting terms is attached to the land ownership or not... 
- Regen is basically:
	- a) unlocking a bunch of nonexistent funding based on proof of regeneration (which requires and maybe incentivises a degraded plot in the first place because it's basically a non-governmentally approved baseline and credit scheme that grandfathers credits to people with the most degraded plots in the first place). So the best strategy would be to make money by degrading the shit out of a place first and then unlock more capital by then putting it on Regen's ledger 
	- b) repricing the value of a land parcel which (like any alternative financing and accounting scheme) does not do anything other than redistribute the 'value' in time or among people. It unlocks capital to different people. E.g. it could be quite powerful if one could unlock loans to regenerators to actually acquire land (which is one of the main problems in the first place) to then get land and regenerate it and sell the credits back to the bank. (so they're asset backed credits that represent soil health and carbon sunk in the end?) (edited)
- Does it actually create a sort of shift in the game whereby there's a race to the top so that all actors will want to unlock capital via Regen credits? Because there's actual value there that can get priced in to accrue to the value of the land? I'm not sure. Depends on basically whether it's easier to make money that way by doing regenerative work than to just make money via sitting on land anyway because people need land (edited)
- Maybe real farmers want real good land. But yeah I was just thinking about what the actual problems we'd be trying to solve actually are (notwithstanding appreciative inquiry and that nature will solve the problems anyway over a long time).
- It's not just how to regenerate soil, sink carbon or how to provide people with food security or provide people with agency over their basic needs, or stop the forest getting cut down for soy beans, or make farming profitable. Is it to engender a system which propagates all of the above? I don't know.
- But what's clear is that farming is fucked not because people don't know how to do good shit. But that economic systems tell them to do stupid shit. And it's basically impossible to farm profitably because land.
- Paulo sent me this: [A agricultura na metrópole | Instituto Escolhas](https://agriculturanametropole.escolhas.org/): Conheça, de forma interativa, o potencial e os desafios para a produção de alimentos na região metropolitana de São Paulo.

- And all the case studies showed new farming around urban centres to be unprofitable. Unless you ignore the cost of land (which is of course stupid). Why do people cut down forests for soy plantations instead of grow it nearby? Why do people plant fields and fields of lettuce or soy in the first place? Food scarcity is generally about maldistribution rather than underproduction. These are all economic problems. Having to pay more for good land or the practices to regenerate land still costs more than industrial agriculture... and so makes regenerative farming even less profitable or able to compete than it already is
- So is Regen just another scheme to unlock tranches of capital against a new metric (which anyone can make up as a 'store of value' so long as anyone believes in it)? Or does it actually change behaviour? It's a post-hoc reward for good behaviour if one manages to sell the credits
- And people only buy the credits to meet their obligations under e.g. a cap and trade system. Which doesn't function unless there's a mandated cap. That's coming down and forcing business to buy credits to offset their shitty activities.
- So the government has to make a market on the demand side for these credits and then it's a combination of a baseline and credit scheme (Regen) and a cap and trade scheme (government) which gets people in whatever hacky way to want to practise regenerative agriculture BUT ONLY AFTER they've signed up and gotten a shoddy baseline with regen
- But this also has a side effect of pricing people out of land (I don't see how you can separate the credits from the land in a meaningful way or whether that's desirable) in a system where they still have to compete against industrial agriculture on price for food production
- So it's not a solution to farming. It's a solution to offer capitalists an alternative place to park their money, and depending on how that works... it's a backdoor to land reform that redistributes who gets access - especially if a financial asset arises which enables one to access loans in fiat to purchase the land on the basis of a promise to regenerate it
- I'm just not sure what the actual problems are that need to be solved here.
- Real farmers want real good quality land but not if they have to pay for it
- Because there's a hole in the bucket. The entire rest of the economic system which you have to compete against
- Basically short-termist industrial agriculture still needs to get made unprofitable first which in this economic system only happens when the resource base has been completely degraded first and scarcity of e.g. fertilizer has been ensured
- Efficiency upgrades to a farming process will get rewarded in the long run via accounting methods such as net present value, because ultimately farmers will be saving on costs once they get past the upfront capital hurdle to finance the improvements. But regeneration? I really don't think regenerative economics can work in this economic system unless there's a mathematical separation.
- Because the mathematics are not regenerative
- It's still a scarcity based paradigm
- Something stinks
- [https://regen-network.gitlab.io/whitepaper/Economics.pdf](https://regen-network.gitlab.io/whitepaper/Economics.pdf "https://regen-network.gitlab.io/whitepaper/Economics.pdf") This explains well that Regen can create a reliable information space for ecological state. Sure. But then to what end? Why would people do it? Why would anyone do regenerative agriculture?
- I mean this is a feat in and of itself and probably will come in handy. But the economic problem is not solved. Needs to be solved from the ground up of people actually choosing whether or not to, and in fact, actually doing the desired outcome
- Is the basic idea of Regen's end function that it redistributes financial capital and investment towards a land regeneration industry?
- The problem is that this system still requires people to factor regeneration into their 'want' while at the same time, they get no benefit from doing that. Their purchasing power does not go up when they do that. It still goes down. Profits do not go up while doing that. Regeneration is still a 'cost' to purchasing power/social allocation of the common pool resources. Therein lies the rub. The system Roberto and I were talking about flips that around.
- The valuation of ecosystem services approach only solves one part of the issue which is internalisation of costs. But they shouldn't be represented as costs but as an investment into wealth. That requires a deeper economic change
- I need to write up this fucking shit man
- I will not be able to rest properly until I do
-  It's all arse backwards. You should basically get spending power from your society for regenerative acts and lose it for consumptive acts. Therein arising a balance.
- These are questions of social construction which the ancient Greeks were totally preoccupied with. Read Plato's The Republic. Or look up the Sacred Band of Thebes. They were like... oh yes.. if we tie a person's sense of love to this lever over here and make a band of Lovers who would then employ the psychology of love to make them a war machine capable of fighting to the death then that might work. Nobody would drop their shield for shame toward their lover. They would fight to the death to protect their lover. Or... what about if we made a utopia and the nobles had to be intermarried co-parents. Then that ties service to the state to service towards their loved ones. Etc... (edited)
- Economic exchange could only convey information about consumption through the medium of things available and their prices. So you need other information in the communication medium to achieve holistic management of the resource base and tie that to signals which condition human behaviour accordingly. If you want to use a system of numbers that is... People used to operate on Norms, responsibilities, fear of gods and threat of sanction, ostracism, force, etc... sometimes reward (edited)
- The proof of regeneration behind some sort of regen tokens must lead to tokens being minted out of thin air or their value increase commensurate with the 'ecosystem service value' and then they need to be fungible and people need to be willing to accept them as payment... to get anywhere close to that. It's not sufficient to just have them unlock capital but still be accounted for as a cost in the production of food for example. It needs to be accounted that food was produced and land was improved. That would take some sort of government level change imo to accept the credits as payment and make sure there's not a whole lot of bullshit happening to make them up.
- So everyone everywhere ought to be able to earn Regen tokens for doing regenerative activity... and spend those tokens for food.
- Having verifiable proof of improvement is only the first step and has issues
