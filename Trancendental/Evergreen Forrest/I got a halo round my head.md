# I got a halo round my head
> "I got a halo round me, I got a halo round my head"  ~ [Porcupine tree](https://youtu.be/fcrWM1pHuJE)

Woah, the last few weeks dating Alex have been intense but extreamly nourishing for me; an exhilarating rush thats felt concerningly addictive. Travel contingency disrupted then our shared recursion and the discontinuity gave rise to reflection; being so close and then suddenly becoming seperate was a lot of contrast!  
  
This context switch brought for me a sense of uncertainty and confusion about our patterns of interaction. Something felt 'up' and I've been reconciling a sense of withdrawal from the previous week. Wednesday the 31st some things felt like they started to come together.  
  
Reflecting on initial withdrawls, it seems that various parts of myself have been in conflict; one passenger wants the same intense closeness, another seemed to want certainty/order/stability and yet another wanted freedom from interpersonal obligations entirely. The middle passenger had it right and I sense this is whats currently emerging, at least I'm feeling resolve and hope she is too. A speculation at this point is that these passengers are perhaps beyond us and transpersonal. 
  
Enter a revelation; two particular forms of the first passenger seem to have been getting drunk together. They might be characterized as the narcissist and cheerleader. I'm not sure but these characters feel like they could be exhiles that were both pretty thirsty. 
  
From our distance, I started to pick up a sense that I'd over shared on context (my narcissist probably had) and noticing a disconnect started to become confused by the hard switch of modality. This is actually pretty unsurprising as we were no longer in the same environmental context but I couldnt put my finger on ... something ... but it led to insight.
  
Going to bed on Wednesday, I felt a desire to send some affection but not wishing to bore or teather Alex with embedding context (or implict demands for attention etc.) I optimised for sentimental content and sent some warm wishes before putting the phone down (with an intention of reassurance in unstability and freedom to just hear it and not respond). Still, there was a sense of fear present while doing so which seemed odd, but also linked to the sense of over sharing.   
  
Coming back into my room a little later I discovered that she had decided to respond. I left the message unchecked for a bit (seemingly the third passenger was present) but with the words 'its easier to give than recieve' echoing in my head I decided the most considerate thing to do was to check the response and resolve to leave her alone after that. 
  
It was a sweet message, and she seemed to care enough to elaborate her context despite what sounded like a tired cheerleader. I'd heard this passenger before in relation to her work context, but god - this is supposed to be play! I mulled on other signals from her past such as a frustrated sounding expression of 'I live to serve' on the Sunday which also reverberated within me. In essence she seemed to lack vitality asking about my context and that didn't feel right, there was care there but I felt like my impulse to send care had become an obligation. 

Thats when I had a flash of insight; there's a narcissist within me and he gets on very well with her cheerleader. Both of which are pbobably on a come down from previous weeks of ecstacy and elation. 
  
Woah. Big shadow I didn't know I had. That guy's probably been haunting me for a while; I've noticed his arrogance arise before when inappropriately shamed (for he is shameless) but this is the first time I'm noticing the wider complex (rather than just a symptom). Tuesdays renunciation I guess... But to effectively let him go I'll need to stoke the ashes within. Who is he and why does he show up?  
  
... So the easiest way to view these two characters is myself embodied as the narcissist and Alex as the cheerleader right? Yes, but having probed him a bit I suspect it's not so simple becaues I can see that both passengers reside within me alone! Theres something about Alex in particular that brings him out though which makes me wonder if there is perhaps complementary inverse ratio living in her? 

Where does this narcissist come from? And also why do I also get a sense that he's usually shy? My first guess was that it's to do with being under seen in some way... but that's pretty surface level. 
  
Weaving the threads together though I sense that the narcissist probably arises out of numerous self sacrificing experiences over the last few years; my own inner cheerleader has been in charge too long and he's become the fire fighter? Hmm, yeah that feels a good deal closer alright.
  
Building community and raising capacity has felt like something to be proud of but reflecting on the experience of cheering others on is actually pretty thankless as well. The emotional labour of educating without indoctronating is often unseen or taken for granted.  
  
So is this where his arrogance comes from? Something as selfish as "I've done my service yet im unthanked"? Perhaps so since he clearly likes the acceptance but also shrinks from it. Is this because such activity is meant to be altruistic and consequently he tries to deny his spiritual materialism? Yeow, living in the basement... That's a big fucking shadow to discount from my past efforts. I sense this is true. Shame the bastard! (though he is shameless...)
  
Coming back to the interpersonal again, what is it about Alex that brings him out? If my inner cheerleader is in exhile then the narcissist is probably lonely and has an unmet need to be told he's not bankrupt, he's after external validation as the internal validator is what got us off course in the first place... But for her, whats the unmet need? My sense is that the narcissists shamelessness is a desirable quality and perhaps the cheerleader needs something to cheer on and believe in? Pride in the face of ridicule and dissent may perhaps be character affordances that she desires. Hard to speak for another despite some portion of these matters being interpersonal. I'll have to ask!

One further note of interest before I close this out is that nourishing the narcissist is that it's restoring balance, my inner cheerleader is coming back online - I can see it in my behaviour. I can also see that his own sense of worth has been attenuated by hearing Alex's tired cheerleader and is perhaps where some of the fear has been coming from. Nothing wrong with a narcissist that has himself in check, that's called pride. When he's afraid of seeing his reflection however, it's another story! 

To what exteames should these characters be nurtured? The middle ground between narcissist and cheerleader seems to be well tempered pride -  is this the ground we both seek?
