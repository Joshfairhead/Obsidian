# 33 The Day I Went Infinite
 Written [[2021-09-02]]
 
---

My birthday, typically the most difficult day of the year for me for several reasons. 1) I don't particularly like spotlights, 2) the relationship with my mother is quite transactional, this is a date where the expectation upon me is to trade my affection for the profane - material bribes and so forth, gifts with expectation and conditionality - thus not gifts. My wishes not to perform this ritual are never respected and even mentioning them brings discord. Rocks and hard places essentially.

Aside from personal feelings I also see the significance of dates in general as quite arbitrary. The Gregorian calendar is clearly full of errors (regarding the continuity of planetary cycles), so what makes this assignment meaningful? The power to believe and that's about it IMO.

This is the context behind this note.

Other years have been very tough to navigate but I'm proud of myself this round. There was little tension and my actions flowed in the appropriate ways. I think everyone got what they really wanted.

A few days before the cursed day, I mentioned to my father the desire avoid transactionality and commerce with my mother. I told him that if we had to go for a meal on my mothers wishes (I'd rather treat the day as any other), then my wish would be to pay for everyone. He was fine with this.

The day unfolded pleasantly, no imperatives pushed upon me (especially in the morning) which was pleasant. I set off for a restaurant with my mother, my father following in his car with the dog. We arrived sat down and ordered. Tension between the parents was present but minimal (they were separating and were in the process of mediation). This was smoothed over and after eating my father grabbed the bill, despite my expressed wishes. It was a gift without being explicit and my wish to pay would have probably caused some form of guilt in my mother - though she wouldn't have issues with appropriating from him (as in her eyes he's taken from her). Thus it was a good move on his part to have ignored me and made the gesture he did in such a non-transactional spirit.

Upon return the necessary commerce was scheduled to begin. Overkill as expected; a little bit of weed, an aeropress, a hammock and Ð„200. I was promptly warned about refusing the currency or returning it and so ate the heartache of such profanity. We had coffee, cake and then they went their separate ways; my father going to sort the boats rigging out and mother doing something across the bay. I gladly smoked a spliff on my own with the dog howling for being left behind. Actually I smoked several before deciding it was time to meditate down by the water to relax after the unfulfilled potential for combustion. I was glad that this possibility went another direction than anticipated but still left saddened by the days transactionality and the inability to be heard on the matter.

As I had somewhat delayed at the table to be on my own for a while I hadn't realised that my father was already back from his dip. Passing through the house to grab my water and timer I entered the kitchen to find him in HIS birthday suit, or at least the bottom half of it. More gestures, this time in a more synchronistic way than intentional. He's often been told to cover himself throughout the years, either by my mother or by myself and the brother (for teenage embarrassment). He still harbours a feeling of being repressed about this it seems. An the lack of fucks given about this day seemed no accident - almost intentional, though not premeditated. My interpretation of this was that he was saying "remember where you came from" in his own way. Had I said anything I'm sure I would have met a rebuttal along these lines; but I said nothing other than excusing myself from the room and getting on with my own stuff. While not expressed, I imagine he was grateful not to be agitated about it "for once" (not that such a situation has occurred in the last ten to fifteen years). He carries the past with him on these kinds of things.

While down on the water, the meditation that came to me was a 369 triad of be loving, act gracefully and think clearly. At the same time, an insight of how to reconcile my desires regarding transactionality with my mothers - take it and spend it on her. She was confusing the language of commerce with correspondence due to her own material value system. Since she had asked me to get her weed earlier in the month, but she didn't like smoking tobacco, while smoked pure it knocked her out - I figured I'd get her a vaporizer. Easy.

This left some anxiety in me as I was in ways rejecting the transaction; she could have just skipped the step of giving me cash and bought it for herself but she'd probably not give herself permission to do such (despite thinking she had cancer and not telling anyone as I've just learnt - happily this isnt the case). Anyway, despite the potential volatility for taking such action (not fitting into her belief system about one way transactionality) I placed the order and later told her that I'd bought HER a birthday gift but it would take a few days to arrive. Speaking of deferred rewards, her response was "I hate when people say these kinds of things" - I realised telling her was a mistake as soon as I mentioned it but too late. On a deeper level I think I wanted her to associate the events of giving and receiving; if she didn't want the gift due to sentimental reasons then at least the situation was symmetrical.

Three days later the vaporizer arrived and I believe she was genuinely pleased. Having heard my use of language over a few weeks, she turned to me and asked "so is this commerce then?". My response was that "it's a middle ground" to which she was satisfied.

In my eyes, this is a pretty odd note. Without the years of context within my family unit it probably sounds like very little, maybe like the situations are normal or you may wonder what the deal is. Some may consider me an ungrateful brat, at least that's how I've been told to feel - which I don't think is fair. What's big about this experience - and infract the extended trip - is that while together, nobody was triggered. Typically someone is getting agitated every second minute; it would seem to me that the family's defence mechanism is to provoke and agitate each other in a vicious cycle.

Somehow this damage was avoided for the duration of my stay. I can't take credit for the behaviours of others but for me its big as I was able to concede my own beliefs in totality, suspend judgemet in entirity and procees why the fuck my familys so damn screwed up... while taking counter measures (word spells) which felt like a valuable contribution towards harmony. Honestly, I'm glad as hell to be out of that (heratbreaking) environment but the experience of sucessfully holding on to my integrity throughout the entire period was something that allows me to feel proud of my actions, if not a little exhausted.
