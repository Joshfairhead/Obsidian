# Astropoiesis

 I've been thinking about Landrys metaphysics and the immanent the nature of life (in the triadic context of alive, vital, creative) and synthesised a new word last night; `Astropoiesis`. 
 
 I'm defining `Astropoiesis` as the Immanent rate of change in relation to becoming and being. The speed at which universe unfolds or the speed at which molecules/atoms etc reconfigure themselves in order for us to move through time/space/the quantum fabric. 
 
 Reasoning through a lens that prioritises the [[Immanent]], the faster the rate of change the more alive something is. The universe in creation - or the present moment - being the fastest rate of change I can possibly imagine. It seems deeply connected with the notion of infinity which also has `accelerationist` implications. 
 
 Grounding things to the **aliveness** of an **individual** - (both terms being being from the Immanent modality themselves - there are three derrivable qualities; **doing, becoming and being**. The [[Immanent]] subsequentially prioritises doing in the present moment.
 
 Repeat the mantra: "I am therefore I do, I do therefore I become, I become therefore I am".

If we want to apply this knowlege to organisations, it can be done, we just have to realise that an organisational unit is of a [[trancendental]] flavour. Aside from that its as easy as changing the mantra to "We are therefore we do, we do therefore we become, we become therefore we are" - its not quite as punchy right? it's probably because its of reconciling tone which has the life of a funeral. If we want to retain an undiluted [[Immanent]] flavour in our orgs then a topology of networked individuals is the structure to prioritise.
 
Note that this note is essentially an [[Accelerationist]] meta-narrative. [[Hyperstition]].

%%Hahahaha, a meta-note on meta-narratives. Turtles all the way down%%
