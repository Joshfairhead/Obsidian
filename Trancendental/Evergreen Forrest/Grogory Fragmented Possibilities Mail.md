Hey Greg,

I've a number of contextual fragments and possibilities around ReSci stuff that I wish to share with you at this point in time if thats ok? Main request here is if you'd act as an Advisor on some this stuff? Heres the wider context:

#### Lunar Punk Labs Reboot
This is a brand I started up in 2020 and won the Odyssey identity track with. However this is going through a rebrand around the resci stuff. I've been trying to figure out how to frame this properly as I've been re-articulating website content and gathering core team while listening to Ned about ReSci DAO. The path forward here seems to be 'facillitating methodology development'. 

The bootstrapping triple thats been guiding my thinking thus far has been projects (+), experts (-), facilitators (=). 

Projects: 
- EthicHub (offered tokens)
- Menthol protocol (offered tokens)
- Regenerating Sonora 
- Precious Plastic 
- Regenerativa Italy 
- Regenerative civics alliance
- Other potentials within Regen networks like Kulshan Carbon Trust 

Experts / Advisors: 
- Ikarus (Climate Collective) 
- Ned / Tica (Regen Science Team) 
- Sam / Rebecca ( ?? )
- Bryan (LPL guild) 
- Robin (LPL guild)
- Adina (Aerth?) 
- Page (??)
- Anthony (H3uni)
- Few others from Paris
 
Facilitators / Team: 
- Me / Maija / Rishi (H3/4th Way) 
- Chris (H3/4th Way) 
- Laura (H3) 
- Roberto (H3)
- Jillian (H3 & her own) 
- Web34Life crew (Regenisis / 4th way / Capra Course) 
- H3uni network / other FTJ attendees

Finance: 
- Gitcoin Grants 
- Regen community pool 
- Bitgreen / Parity pools 
- Celo Climate Collective / Ikarus 
- Tokens from consulting on projects 
- Refi DAO (?)

On the site this will probably become a triple of people, projects, protocols as that arose for me today. Getting content sorted is where things seem to be going. I've a couple of fragments there that feel like they are coming together. 

Onboarding guides have been rewritten and put on ToTheCosmos.org but I'll move these to the website and reserve the Ghost instance for creative writing. I've a number of fragments living in Obsidian to reconcile into blog posts for that one; pieces about 'Digital republics' and 'Accelerating transformation through applied calculus' etc.

When it comes to the "people" section I feel a triple of advisors, contributors, participants is pretty appropriate as distinctions here are probably valuable. 

I know your a pretty busy dude but I wonder if you'd be willing to advise from time to time? Ned then being main PoC/Lead link at Regen Science team to ease the overhead, Tica as secondary link. Happy to work with Sam and Rebecca they just seem preoccupied and less open.
