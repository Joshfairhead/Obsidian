# Emergent Cyclical Theory

> TL;DR: This article covers a systemic conception of psychology articulated by Clare Graves. The first principals he surfaced are foundational to a number of related theories and integrates many others. If your interested in the field you should probably start here before looking at other work.

## **Introduction**

This article is an exposition highlighting my own investigations into the work of Clare Graves; a New York psychology professor who brought the world an evidence based meta-model known as _Emergent Cyclical Theory._ His work is salient to me because due to its broad utility it’s capable of integrating a plethora of existing theories as well as clarifying a lot of confusion around existential questions.

As a species, we are extremely diverse and heterogeneous; resultantly there is a lot of noise and little signal. For many of us, society can seem rife with fragmentation and contradictory views. Gazing through this prism of projections, the black hole of ideology and narrative warfare can feel overwhelming. It’s hard not to get lost in the fractal as such disorder can feel extremely unpredictable, arbitrary and uncertain. This artefact thus originates from a personal desire to discern order from chaos. Are there constants in the complexity of values that drive human behaviour?

Graves' work is grounded in inquiry – as opposed to hypothesis – and highlights the importance of an unfolding evolutionary process rather than the static models and prescriptions often found in other psychological literature. Many of these theories do indeed contain grains of truth but let us momentarily pause to note that there are also many castles made out of sand. 

I’ll endeavour not to mislead you but please note that I’m what you might call an `epistemic trespasser` in these waters so please engage your critical faculties and do your best to remember that “**the map is not the territory!**”

Firstly, I'll prime you with some of the theories history and background. Secondly, I’ll explain the framework and detail some of the research Graves explicated. Thirdly, we’ll discuss the underlying **process** that drives the model with some reflection on its significance and potential use. Finally, I’ll add some of my own experiences and criticism before concluding the essay. 

Enjoy!

## **An Open Inquiry - Essence**

_Emergent Cyclical Theory_ came precariously close to remaining a buried treasure. At one point during the mid 1950's Graves witnessed his friend and colleague Abraham Maslow unceremoniously "torn to pieces" by colleagues at an APA seminar. He subsequently vowed to never put himself into a similar situation until he could adequately defend his own position. Much of his work was later abandoned out of frustration and [the book he was working on](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Ending-Quest-Explores-Treatise/dp/0972474218) remained unpublished until after his death. Only later was it posthumously pieced back together again by peers and archivists digging through his remaining articles, transcripts and seminars.

For me, one of the most salient parts of this theory is that it considers the human condition as _**open-ended**_ with no final state of enlightenment, self-actualization or nirvana. These 'states' may still exist; it’s just that evidence seems to favour an endless search for order in a chaotic universe **without finality**. Even the better known Abraham Maslow embraced this _open-ended_ view despite common interpretations of his work:

> You should know that Maslow came around to my point of view. If you look at his later writings you will see that he accepted both the cyclic idea that there is more than one kind of expressive system and more than one kind of belonging system, and the system is open ended. We finally, after fighting this over for eight years, came to a fundamental agreement along that line. - Graves ([Lee, 2002,  p. 52](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Human-Existence-Clare-Graves/dp/097247420X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Levels+of+Human+Existence&qid=1619128459&s=books&sr=1-1))

The essence of Graves’ work is that humans develop new bio-psycho-social coping mechanisms to deal with existential problems, and these emergent coping mechanisms arise in response to an [increasingly complex environment](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile). As the tide of human progress rises [exponentially](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), it may be that we'll begin to encounter more Buddhas about. Or face existential ruin... # BreakDownOrBreakThrough

⚠️ For those who have done a degree of reading around _Spiral Dynamics,_ or _Ken Wilbur etc_, please do your best NOT to draw comparisons just yet. These works are all indeed very similar and also related but I’m deliberately avoiding discussion on these authors because they draw FROM this foundational work and conflating them may lead to confusion ⚠️

‌

In the early 1950's Graves held a position as a psychology professor at Union College NY where a student of his posited the following question: from all the competing psychological theorists, whose model was ultimately correct? With no immediate answer to hand, and a monkey on his back, Graves could only start collecting the data required to find out!

**He began with the following lines of inquiry:**

1.  Can one provide evidence that conflict and contradiction, confusion and controversy are represented in conceptions of psychological health?
2.  What are the conceptions of psychological health existing in the minds of biologically mature human beings?
3.  Do the concepts which exist suggest that psychological health should be viewed (a) as a state or condition, or (b) as a **psychological process?**
4.  What is the essential nature of psychological health if it is a state or condition?
5.  What is the nature of the **process** of psychological health if the basic research indicates that it should be viewed thus?

**These drivers were then further expanded into research questions in order to generate relevant data:**

1.  How do biologically mature human beings conceive of 'what is the healthy personality'?
2.  Do biologically mature humans have, basically, one major identifiable conception of what the psychologically healthy adult is?
3.  Do biologically mature humans have more than one conception of what a healthy personality is?
4.  If adults have several conceptions of healthy personality, are the conceptions classifiable into groups of similar conceptions?
5.  If the various conceptions are classifiable, how can they be classified?‌  
    ‌(a) by content? (b) structurally? (c) functionally?
6.  Will there be evidence that a singular conception of healthy personality stands out as superior to other conceptions?

**The primary issue surmised:**

_What will be the nature and character of conceptions of psychological health of biologically mature human beings who are intelligent, but relatively unsophisticated in psychological knowledge in general, and in personality theory in particular?_

With these formulations, Graves set out to conduct his research which unfolded in approximately four phases: Data Collection, Classification, Observation and Interpretation. 

### **Phase 1: Primary Data Collection**

At the beginning of Graves investigation he was working in three schools; one all male, another all female and the last was a mixed adult extension division. Over the course of his research he studied a relatively diverse group of about 1,065 subjects aged 18-61.

He needed 'representative' subjects for the purposes of his study; which he found in his relatively unsophisticated first year students who were enrolled on his "Theory of Normal Psychology" program. The classroom became his laboratory and he taught in 'novel' ways to accommodate his study. His methodology was applied to eight sets of students, eight different times in order to generate his primary data.

Upon starting his lectures, he told his students not to read a single thing on psychology for the first five classes. The time was to be spent discussing what one might put into a conception of healthy personality and a personal conception was to be presented in a paper at the end of the five weeks.

In the second five weeks, students were split into random groups and instructed to present their own conception to their peers and receive criticism. Graves observed their reactions and behaviours as their peers "went after them" with critique of their espoused conception. At the end of these additional five weeks, students were to write up a defence or modification of their existing conception. This gave Graves a chance to observe if and how conceptions changed under peer influence.

In a third interval of five weeks, the class studied a variety of authorities and again turned in a modification of their original hypotheses. He then sat with randomly selected students to interview them about the process itself; how their conceptions might have changed and the factors that influenced them in changing their minds.

**This data set produced:**

1.  A large set of beliefs around the conception of a healthy psychology.
2.  Reactions to the criticism of espoused beliefs, evidenced in observation and through paper defence and/or modification.
3.  Relation to confrontation with authority as evidenced through paper defence or modification.
4.  Interview data on the process of the primary experience.

**Through this study, a second set of research questions opened up:**

1.  What will happen to a person's characterization of mature human behaviour when s/he is confronted with the criticism of his/her point of view by peers who have also developed their own conception of psychologically mature behaviour?
2.  What will happen to a person's conception of mature human behaviour when confronted with the task of comparing and contrasting his/her conception of psychologically mature human personality to those conceptions which have been developed by authorities in the field?
3.  How will the subjects behave under peer criticism?

### **Phase 2: Classification**

‌

⚠️ Note: Graves later reversed his lettering format; the first letter is for conditions, second for neurology ⚠️

‌

### Discernment and Differentiation

Each year an external panel of judges were instructed to classify the data into categories. This process was then blindly repeated with a second panel of judges.

**The data points repeatedly collapsed into two primary categories:**

1.  Express self; primarily motivated by internal forces.
2.  Deny self; predominantly driven by external forces.

As these two categories emerged each year (unknown to the panel) the research turned into a process of accumulation. Over 8 years, sub-categories also began to emerge in about 60% of the data. This data was later augmented and interpreted through further research in **phase four** of Graves’ inquiry**.**

The primary categories, the labels of which will be expanded on later, and the basic traits of the participants’ conceptions are as follows:

1.  Deny self:‌  
    ‌a) sacrificially - Aka [BO].‌  
    ‌b) for deferred reward - Aka [DQ].‌  
    ‌c) for acceptance now - Aka [FS].
2.  Express self:‌  
    ‌a) as self desires in a calculating fashion, at the expense of others - Aka [ER].‌  
    ‌b) as self desires but not at the expense of others - Aka [GT].

### **Phase 3: Observation of Interactions**

This was probably **the most interesting phase** as it would reveal a good deal of information about how different conceptions tend to interact in the social field. **It's also where the situation began to turn into a somewhat more complex puzzle!**

With formalised classifications, Graves was now able to study his accumulated data and observations in depth.

-   The first task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to peer criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of espoused conceptions; whether and how peer criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with peers in this process.
-   The second task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to authoritative criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of espoused conceptions; whether and how authoritative criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with authority in this process.

By diving into these interaction patterns, the models of each conception were significantly enriched, aiding the ongoing discernment process outlined in phase 2. Why did it seem that there were such radical differences in the same “primary conceptions”?

**To recap; the similarities in the primary conceptions were:**

-   Sacrificial conceptions were responsive to external conditions. They saw denial of self and degrees of conformity as the answer to their existential conditions.
-   Expressive conceptions were NOT responsive to external conditions. They saw self expression as a means to overcome their existential conditions but would move into deny-self modalities when "central change" (movement to other modalities) occurred.

The subject of importance here was the difference between subjects occupying similar conceptions, particularly for enumerating and enhancing resolution on the subcategories. These findings are summarised below.

**Differences between sacrificial conceptions:**‌  
‌Some of deny-self conceptions were dissimilar in relation to their effective change force. Certain subjects (the [DQ] conception) would respond only to an accepted higher authority and NOT their peers, otherwise remaining rigid and defending their initial conceptions to the last. Others however (the [FS] conception) would respond only to peer authority and NOT a perceived higher power. The two classifications were also quite dissimilar in terms of their perceived behavioural freedoms.

**Differences between expressive conceptions:**‌  
‌The express-self conceptions were also quite different in terms of effective change forces. A number of subjects (the [ER] conceptions) would change only through self procured sources, while others (the [GT] conceptions) seemed to respond regardless of where thought or information originated from.

These conceptions were also dissimilar in terms of perceived behavioural freedoms. Certain subjects (the [ER] conceptions) _"always expressed themselves as if tethers were on them, always tying them down"_, while others (the [GT] conception) didn't feel bound to anything much at all - especially the goals of others. These subjects were generally non-argumentative but would often interject about perceived mistakes.

**Group Work:**‌  
‌With increased resolution on the subcategories; students with the same conceptions of psychological maturity were grouped into classes and tasked with a specific problem. These subjects were then left to autonomously form groups and students with a...

• [DQ] conception split up into small feudalistic units, each with separate leaders. ‌  
‌• [ER] conception had a huge argument – with one eventual leader emerging. ‌  
‌• [FS] conception worked well on their own without a leader.‌  
‌• [GT] conception chose the most appropriate leader for the task at hand and later to drop them for someone better suited for the next task.

### **Phase 4: Outliers and Interpretation** 

The last phase was spent interpreting the data through research and factoring in world views from other non-industrialised cultures. These walks of life were were probably factored in to avoid immediacy bias.

Around this time new categories also started to emerge; until this point the available data seemed to point towards a final stage of psychological maturity... but a number of people with the ‘express self but without cost to the others’ conception began to reject their previous views! This contradiction shook Graves’ work at its foundations and for a short time caused him a great deal of confusion.

After the occurrence of these anomalies, people from the working classes began to gain access to higher education and it became evident that an earlier sub-category had been missed out; a remorseless 'express self at all costs' modality whom appeared to espouse a 'law of the jungle' mentality. One where 'might is right'. 

The remorseless [CP] conception was thus the most primordial conception Graves collected himself in his primary sample, though as mentioned prior stages of cognitive evolution were later uncovered through anthropological research.

The subjects of this [CP] conception (‘express self at all costs’) however began to shift in their beliefs - lo and behold - into the already documented conception of 'deny self for later reward'! Thus in one stroke the earlier anomaly of [GT] subjects denying their own prior conceptions was also resolved; they had undergone a **process** of central change and were starting to embrace a yet inconceived modality. **Subsequently**, **these findings paved the way for psychological health to be viewed as a process rather than fixed state.**

‌

HU: Not a model man, Not a saviour or a saint, Imperfect in a world, Make no mistake.

‌

This new category [HU] was as far Graves’ primary data went but he and a number of others believed that it wasn't the end of the journey! Given how old this research is already paired with the [rising complexity of our environment](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile), we may now once again be witnessing the birth of a new conception not listed on the 1974 chart above; the [IV] modality. Graves speculated the progression was a _'six on six ladder'_ or octave – so keep an eye out!

## **The Dialectical Ladder**

‌

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dKfo8yzmpitt1WMoiCWPvXLfkgSIMbdY9UTYYvNj1cv5qOsAu5crdIbIGPv_I9Vt7jp7n8m7bq5dK_ObdXtoCP8j5BT12JUrArvhqvHxVhb_sjvj6AS_ssA683nA3Is5KkXxldMY)

‌

We’ve intentionally been reviewing just the history of the research and how the conceptions were formed so far. At this point we can begin to cover the topic more generally while trying to elicit some insights. The classifications are probably still a bit unclear so let’s cover those in more depth.

The first set of characters in Graves’ notation system [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H] refer to “existential conditions'' or the environment in which we inhabit. While the second set of characters [N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U] refer to what Graves termed “emergent coping mechanisms” – the capabilities we leverage to transcend our environments.

These emergent cycles might be thought of as a swinging pendulum where we oscillate between express-self and deny-self modalities in an unfolding process. What I find particularly interesting about the implications of Graves classifications is the generative dialectic between **environment and organism**.

**To me, this dialectic feels like the difference between aspiration and embodied action;** the environmental context gives rise to a set of needs or desires, which are then slowly manifested through a form of [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) embodied in new and novel behaviours.

‌

Novel behaviours between environment and organism: the Octo-rock

‌

Graves later revised the [GT] and [HU] conceptions to [AN'] and [BO'] as he theorised a _'six on six ladder'._ He did so because these later conceptions closely resembled the earliest stages with a post-subsistance twist. 

**In contrast** to the Gravesian symbol system of letter pairings; the colours, categories and “value-memes” typically reified in _Spiral Dynamics_ and related materials seem to grossly overlook this generative interplay, reducing it into a static typing system – something that I personally find unhelpful. This focus on static categories is a reductive fallacy that has been used to claim high ground and author legitimacy narratives. In my opinion Graves avoids this pitfall by maintaining a focus on dialectic and process. 

### Generative Friction

‌

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/C2ZW1RuGrkpsdTAFiRs2zhLHyoSheVcNQGvSNZZ7qhmdwgVyiy8QfyEiYWyPsnXsqtXCaajQtdYCDv1YHSbI7P4HVl-HD7zLPB3GlZNsWQ9a-cxTxaRNu1Olc8fHq1QVGqXmSF9c)

‌

As you might imagine – there can be quite a tension between existential conditions and the formation of 'emergent coping mechanisms'. This friction is perhaps akin to the myth of [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) pushing a boulder uphill for all of eternity. Once a local maximum is reached in this seemingly open ended system, the boulder rolls back down again to a new local minimum. Once more we begin work on our next existential challenge!

So, having now acquainted ourselves with the various psychological conceptions; and more importantly **the process** of [structural coupling](https://metadesigners.org/Structural-Coupling-Glossary) which occurs between actor and environment, the most interesting questions (for me) become:

-   what actually occurs during this generative **process** of transformation?
-   and how do such bio-psycho-social phase shifts happen?

Lets zoom in on the transformative process:

1.  **Potential**‌  
    ‌The necessary “higher order structures” must be present within the organism – which Graves saw as neurological systems within the brain. Unfortunately, further resolution on this matter has eluded me during the course of my investigations. ‌  
    ‌‌  
    ‌[Dąbrowski's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration#Development_potential) work on positive disintegration may be relevant however; he points to the factors of over-excitability, personal capabilities and drive for autonomy as significant factors in the development of an “independent personality”. At the organisational level, we might speculate that these structures could be represented by the variety of people, rituals, values, coordination protocols, practices and [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics) available within a group.‌  
    ‌
2.  **Resolution of existential problems**‌  
    ‌Stages of expanding (and contracting) awareness cannot be skipped or bypassed. Problems faced at earlier stages of existence must be resolved in order to release psychic energy for advance. First things first!‌  
    ‌
3.  **Feelings of dissonance**‌  
    ‌A breakdown of solutions to one’s immediate existential problems MUST be faced along with a period of crisis and regression. The dissonance of this situation is required to catalyse biochemical changes that drive a regressive search for old patterns of behaviour in order to establish a previous apparent solution to the situation. Such a search is certain to end in arrestment, regression or growth as old solutions to previous problems DO NOT apply to the new context any better than the way of life whose inadequacy triggered the search initially. This might be considered a form of psychological [bifurcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory).‌  
    ‌
4.  **Gaining of insights**‌  
    ‌Putting an end to the regressive search, unlocking the formation of new structures and propelling an evolution to the next modality, is **insight**. This insight MUST enable the organism to find an equilibrium in the immediate environment.‌  
    ‌
5.  **Removal of barriers**‌  
    ‌When this insight is reached, few in the environment will share the same understanding and thus the barriers of friends, family, processes etc. must be overcome or ignored to make such a leap.‌  
    ‌
6.  **Opportunity to consolidate**‌  
    ‌The last necessary condition for the emergence of new structures is a consolidation factor which comes into play as the organism begins to practice and affirm the new behaviour. Here the implementation of insights are being achieved and accomplished.  

### **Engaging with transformation**

Having hopefully grokked the various conceptions and **the deeper process** of transformation; how do we leverage this understanding? Can it be used to help us judge appropriate actions in a given context to empower both ourselves and other individuals while navigating transition? What **insights** might help us help us to flourish?

Perhaps the first key is to accurately diagnose the terrain we're traversing, figure out what’s needed and/or desired before prioritising an appropriate pattern or schema that enables us to overcome our immediate obstacles. Different conceptions are seemingly responsive to different processes.

**Let’s sample a selection of potentially useful approaches:**‌  
‌In most modern cultures, the [AN] and [BO] stages are primarily found in toddlers. Learning is through habituation and [Pavlovian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) conditioning; an associative linear process whereby stimulus provokes a response. The classic example is a dog drooling while its dinner is being prepared, but the same process also applies in large to dementia and substance addiction (e.g. [a junkie searching out a bag of heroin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwlogyj7nFE)).

For a loose cannon at the [CP] stage; benevolent autocracy is often warranted. It might sound draconian but given complete freedom inhabitants of this modality will absorb as much space as possible while openly fleecing others of their agency; if you give an inch, they'll take a mile. Graves references [B.F. Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner), [August Aichhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Aichhorn) and [Kurt Eisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_R._Eissler) as relevant therapies stating _"you put this person in a_ [_box_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber) _psychologically and you don't let him out. You've got to know and accept those rules!"._ Most subsistence modalities will have immense difficulties dealing with this conception due to the limitations of their own ontology.

Working with the [DQ] stage, Graves suggests [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) is pretty much the only person who ever had a clue. These subjects need gentle hand-holding and a personal relationship in order to overcome their fears, break down unhelpful positions and foster trust… thereafter moving along at a snail's pace to lead them back into a sense of embodied self. These people need to see the engaging party as an acceptable authority figure or they’ll remain hidden in their shell without conceding an inch.

The [ER] modalities gain insight only from what they can procure for themselves, gauging their expectations against outcomes. In this regard, [encounter groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-groups), wherein people gather to express felt experiences arising out of personal interactions are good places to receive useful feedback. Worth noting however is if the (out) group is unknown to the [ER] centred personality, they'll often observe and leverage the weakness of others members of the group to exploit and instrumentalise them.

For those centred in an [FS] modality, Graves held that the [Rodgerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy) approach was _"a very fine one"._ Many of these methods are similar to the [ER] interventions minus the training wheels. Particular methods such as the [Rodgerean Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument) however, are considered more suitable than others. As the [FS] modality has embarked on a journey of self-exploration they are predominantly asking "why?" questions, so an authentic and congruent 1:1 relationship facilitates deeper inquiry and a shared context.

We'll stop here as [GT] and [HU] conceptions are open on all channels, learning from every encounter and situation. Discussion on these modalities will also be relatively speculative. 

## Reflections

As I've been writing this document, I can say that the conceptions feel quite real in relation to my own journey. A schema is not something I’ll ever take for gospel but the framework does fit my past with large degrees of accuracy. I can see a cycle of personal conceptions that have repeatedly arisen and broken down again while oscillating upon the carrier wave of my life:

BO > CP: The modality throughout my teenage years was clearly that of deny-self. Socialised mind did its best to fit in with kin spirits and fill a group niche. This semi-autistic version of myself was eventually perturbed into a sense of self-awareness via a romantic rejection.

CP > DQ: During my university years I moved into an express-self modality. I was ferociously exercising, prolifically writing music and dating regularly. At one point in this cycle a dear friend of mine got fed up with the impulsive behaviour and hit me with the statement “you can’t just keep talking over people man”; the guilt of which once again transformed my world view.

DQ > ER: My early career seems to accurately fit a deny-self modality where I felt quite disembodied; watching myself in third person while smoking away external tensions as a form of escapism. While working for a particularly imperialistic employer the thought of further subordinating myself to such tyrannical authority began to grate on me. When the opportunity arose, I quit my job and started a company of my own.

ER > FS: As captain of my own ship I moved into an express-self modality; installing sound systems for several high end venues while also beginning to invest in speculative assets. I expanded into night club tech management and eventually burnt myself out on graveyard shifts – moving into a well paid technology job shortly thereafter. My calculated boundary pushing there provoked push back and brought down the wrath of others, eventually leading to being made redundant as the startup began to run out of funding.

FS > GT: Leaving the world of employment behind to search out like minded peers seems to accurately reflect the “deny-self for acceptance now” conception. I joined a variety of self-organising initiatives and after some time found refuge in the countryside with a peer. The pace was slow and the location isolating so a sense of dissonance crept in, resultantly I felt moved to affirm myself and have begun to seek stability on my own grounds. This is actually my current situation and at this point I’m still finding a sense of flow while practising new patterns – I’ve not crossed the river quite yet but I am starting to near the bank.

It appears that many sources suggest that the FS > GT transition is the hardest to work through. However, the reasoning for these assertions seem quite thin on the ground and so I feel compelled to share my own experience of this transition. Stated bluntly it feels like I’ve stripped myself of all character leaving a bland core essence thats been pretty unresponsive and spaced out. The upside hawever is an honest sense of self-awareness. I also seem to be embedded in a process of rebuilding my “avatar” in a systematic way from the ground up unintentionally taking on the properties of each stage that seems to change every two months or so. There's also a growing sense of self-acceptance (which I thought I’d already found) coming from an open disclosure of my internal world.

‌

‌

### Criticism

While exploring and reflecting on this model, I’ve been taking it with a pinch of salt and reading between the lines. From this perspective it feels pretty solid and I honestly don’t have a huge amount of criticism. Taking a more literal perspective however it seems that some of the terminology might benefit from minor adjustments in framing. 

In particular Graves seems to frame the process from a lens of coping and problem solving which we might say is a form of goal orientation. This seems at odds with his otherwise predominant process orientation; and so perhaps we can view the transitions as a process of healing from damage incurred in prior modalities.

Throughout this article I’ve also been cautious not to call the conceptions “levels” – as many transcripts do – because such words can easily lead to a sense of elitism. This is rife in the _Spiral Dynamics_ communities which draw upon this work and tends to turn many people off. Graves himself noted in a number of transcripts that “levels'' were uncorrelated with intelligence and that it's more a case of understanding how people do what they do, or how they believe what they believe. 

While it seems that the research methods were generally robust; the [AN] and [BO] conceptions were inferred through extensive study of anthropological literature as previously mentioned. This seems fair in the context of his study and a necessary step to avoid the immediacy bias of solely relying on his own sample; however by looking for conceptions outside his sample and finding them it opens the potential for confirmation bias. Ahh, the thin line and endless double bind! 

# Conclusion

It seems apparent to me at this point that _Emergent Cyclical Theory_ has a wide range of implications across a number of fields; particularly in government, business, healthcare, education and social science. We might thereby consider it an aid for anticipating potential futures, or as a lens for [systemic intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_intervention); with the right eyes and ears it can help enable us to tailor an appropriate response to a given context and meet it in place with right (or deliberately wrong) action! 

Further to that, _Emergent Cyclical Theory_ seems pretty applicable to the emerging fields such as cryptocurrency, artificial general intelligence and computer science as they are all artefacts of how we think. These [encoded ideologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ3gmh-d9oI) are the products of our environmental coupling which then become concrete realities and shape the affordances of our daily lives. Having an awareness of what’s shaping us and the modality that created it is an incredibly important notion to be aware of… and perhaps even more so in the reverse; how we’re using our agency to shape the world and others around us is a deep ethical concern that we can probably all be more aware of. How are we contributing? What values are driving our actions and behaviour? How much hubris is involved?

Navigating the tensions present in daily life feels analogous to matching voltage; wherever there's an ontological mismatch there's a energetic bottleneck that restricts flow and leaks potential. Stepping and blending these energetics is an art form I could personally use more practice in, yet having an sense of where others are coming from is certainly helpful in attempting such alchemy!

Perhaps beyond this is a notion of [situationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International); the conjuring of moments which enable us to grow in safe to fail environments at the collective scale. Performance events and circumstances which test our capacities and surface our ontologies for what they are; fragile beliefs, attachments and conditioned patterns. As Graves initially pondered; can exposure to confusion, contradiction, controversy and conflict help us to become better adapted to our existential environment? I personally think so, but buyer beware, it can be exhausting when sustained over long periods of time!

None the less my recommendation is:

“Buy the ticket, take the ride”

Good luck,
