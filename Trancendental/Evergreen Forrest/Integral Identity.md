# Integral Identity


### Moderate the middle
Identity is a sprawling topic and there are multiple perspectives on what it is exactly. I'd suggest that there are two high level categories these conversation tend to fall into - **natural identity and legal identity** 

It's worth noting that these flavours can also be viewed at different scales; **singular and collective**. To illustrate, heres a 2x2 matrix:

## Primer
The core problem with Identity is the myriad of deeply entangled belief systems with conflicting world views. To get to the core of things let's differentiate and integrate the assumptions that underlay each ideology. 
	
By simply observing them through a cultural, historical and linguistic lens we can begin to grok the problem. 

**Natural Identity: Eastern, Subjects, Verbs, Networks, Edges, Buddha, Feminine**
Eastern countries and Indigenous cultures often speak in the form of verbs where context is inferred. "Hungry" can either mean that the subject is hungry, or it can be a question of another. Buddhism for example has a relational ontology where we are the connections or edges between things. 

**Legal Identity: Western, Objects, Nouns, Structures, Vertexs, Newton, Masculine**
Western countries have developed from a noun like paradigm. We say things like "tell the truth" as if "truth" is real and objective. We often come at problems through a lens of atomistic reductionism where the whole is simply a sum of parts. 

### Its a Dilemma!
Given that the polarities have valid view points on both sides, both need integration in a harmonious manner. If we let Legal identity become all encompassing, then we'll probably find our agency subsumed and end up in a dystopian nightmare. If we remain solely in the Natural identity camp and say that it's purely relational and contextual; then the subject remains eternally ephemeral!  

The above picture perhaps outlines a more integrative perspective. The primary concern however is not whats contained within the various quadrants; it's how they interact and influence each other! The technical term for this phenomena is structural coupling, which is increasingly relevant to the behaviours and breakdowns of the population due to the structural violence inherent in social systems. We need to break the cycles!

### Moderate the middle
Socio-technology is inherently political. It's about codifying ideologies. It's about governance; whatever becomes enshrined proceeds to shape us. What we think is normal is most often built on an underlying set of assumptions that has already conditioned us. We need to step back and ask "why?"
