# Dark Triads and the Shadow

An Irish triad of admirable qulaites stayed with me from a site I visited; proud, brave and strong. Noticing an unreasonable sense of fear in myself for some reason, I got thinking about the dark or inverted triad of these qualities; ashamed, fearful and weak. I started playing with them as a means of doing shadow work and uncovering complexes; a flashlight went on in the dark:

Zooming into the modes of fear, shame and guilt, they seem to share common traits of "bad, different, alone" in different temporalities. Fear is an anticipation of these traits, shame is the felt sense of these traits being imposed and guilt is a sense of having been these traits. Think about it.

Relating the two triads - can fear, shame or guilt be felt in the felt presence of good, same, together? Probably not. I queried myself throught both these lenses and stumbled into a whole interior world I was unaware of. Crikey. 

Caverns.
