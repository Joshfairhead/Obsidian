# Alive - Vital - Creative

An essay on Will.

### Alive
When talking of aliveness, we are describing life in a state of action. Aliveness is thus an active or energetic modality which reflects vitality, or the 'having of life', through the process of doing. In more personal terms, one might call aliveness the outward display of vital essence, or the growth of character. 

### Vital
Vitality refers to a passive essence which provides the necessary conditions from which aliveness (life) can flourish. It may be considered as the state of being which permits outward growth into the world. Phrased more metaphorically it is the ground from which things grow. 

### Creative
Invoking the term creativity signifies an emergent or trancendental state that reconciles both being and doing. It precipitates from realms unknown into insight, bearing the fruits of growth.

### Dangerous abstractions

If these categories sound abstract to you, your probably not alone - they are three distinct metaphysical attractors that can sum up the unfolding of most anything. This essay isn't about metaphysics thankfully, but it does draw on the dicipline to help organise thoughts in a logical and transparent way. Without such this writing would be entirely arbitrary and lack legitimacy of any kind. 

In fact this may still be the case, but at least the reasoning and significance of the imparted information remains open to interrogation; the verification of truthfulness is thus left to the readers own discernment and judgement.

From here we shall proceed to make things more concrete so that lightning may hit the ground, earthing itself through you.

### Structure
Although one may reason that vitality is primary, it is not the case. Without the activity of life, there can be no state of vitality. Without doing there is no doing. In all truth, the logic is circular and all three classes are modes of the same thing, each preceeding eachother. This is just why the essay takes the form it does, but it also serves as a reminder that for any words to be effective one needs to act. "I am therefore I do, I do therefore I become, I become therefore I am"

So - we start with aliveness, move to vitality and finish with creativity.

### Nourishment
Upon our creation at the very beginning of life we require nourishment. This is fundemental. We are nourished in three ways; the actions of eating, breathing and experiencing. The quality of this nourishment depends upon the the consumed substances; in this case the nutritional content of our food, the purity of the air and the form of our experience.

We shall thus work on and ealaborate the following foundations:
- Excersise
- Nutrition
- Meditation

#### Excersise

#### Nutrition
Nutritional food is easy to find in most developed countries, and all food consists of three macro nutrients; carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Later we'll look at quick and easy vegaterian recipies that contain beneficial content. 

- [[Roast Brocolli and Potatoes]]
- [[Lentils with Rice]]
- etc.

#### Meditation
You may have heard the term "the breath of life" before, it essentially refers to metabolism. In simple terms we inhale oxygen and exhale carbondioxide. The real situation is more complex and it seems that hydrogens also play a role in maintaining homeostasis anmongst other things. None the less breathing is important, and yet we give so little thought to it! 

As such we'll cover a number of meditative excersises that can help bring our centers into alignment.
