# Have a Clear and Definite Aim

 From _definitus_ ‘defined, set within limits’.

Have a clear and definate aim. Always look for the eignvalue for the present moment; the thing thats immanent right now. It's small, like walking home to get some water, but if it's achieved or contingency strikes, a new clear and definite aim need to be formulated. This reformulation can proceed forever as an infinite game and by doing so, one expresses volition. How fast can the path be sustainably walked? 

Without a corresponding eignvalue of the infinite moment this volition is essentially arbitrary and so requires an overarching ideal from which to gauge action in the present. This larger overarching ideal may simply be one picture, but it should update to a small degree every time an aim in service to it is achieved. Increase the frame rate by having a base line and completing small aims regularly.
