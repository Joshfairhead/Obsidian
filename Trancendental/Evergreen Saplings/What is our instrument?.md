# What is our instrument?

**Metaphysics:**
3: Immanent
6: Omnicient
9: Trancendental

Prioritises the Immanent. Bennets chief characteristic of three is Dynamicism 
What is the triad of the Immanent/Dynamicism? Or is it better to shift gears for greater resolution?

The most Immanent thing we can know is our understanding of the present moment and relation to it. I've mashed together term [[Astropoiesis]] as the immanent rate of change between becoming and being. In other words; doing.

3: Doing
6: Becoming
9: Being

Now, we can zoom in on doing with another triad or we can try to increase our resolution by shifting system to a Tetrad or "Field of action". Note that [[Forrest Landry]]s triadic metaphysics prioritises the [[Immanent]] which seems carry the same properties as [[John Bennet]]s triad - [[Dynamicism]]. Thus it seems that Bennets Tetrad with denoted by as a "field of action" (probably derriving from function in his master triad) is an enhanced resolution of the [[Immanent]]. Logically they match and it all follows quite nicely. 

If we look at Bennets Tetrad it has the terms:
- Directive agency
- Instrumental means
- Ground 
- Ideal

The most [[Immanent]] term amongst these is "Directive agency". If we are the directive agency it leaves a neat triad that fits with his metaphysical attractors:
3: Instrumental means (Function)
6: Ground (Being)
9: Ideal (Will)

This begs the question then as to whats our instrumental means or tools? This is probably best answered in Tetradic form but for now its:
3: Dvorak 
6: Obsidian
9: Words (Trivium)

If the pattern so far follows that subject and object are in service to the immanent (function in Bennets terminology), and then steping up a level to tetrads we see that the immanent gains resolution as directive agency. At fiveness, this gets clearer again - quintessence of the system.
