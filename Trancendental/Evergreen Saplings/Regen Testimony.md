# Regen Testimony

#### Intro
Today I noticed Pospis post on white supremecy in relation to the Regen space. The piece was well written and encouraged generative dialogue so I feel compelled to respond. I don't wish to perpetuate blame and hatred though so I'm cautious about sharing this story publically. I will likely seek council from Greg before sharing with Pospi and from there others who were involved. 

Why would I wish to respond to this post? Honestly I'm not sure I do - but theres a lingering sense that I should for some reason. Maybe its a sense of responsibility for an experience that feels unresolved, incomplete and lacking in wholeness. I can see pain that needs healing and when wholeness strays from the path this is whats needed. 

#### Context
So [this post](https://pospi.spadgos.com/2022/07/04/blockchain-regen-permaculture-and-white-supremacism/) perturbed me. It caused me to reflect on some interactions I had **within** the Regen Foundation which I feel I handled poorly. 

What I noticed however was that the write up was a response to a twitter blow up that I can only see the conclusion of. 

At this point it's worth mentioning that the title did not attract me to the gig; I applied for the enDAOment officer gig as I have been a community change agent for some time, however during the interview process I was asked what I considered the networks most important fundemental? Instead of saying community I answered based on first principals and said data integrity (as the newtwork would otherwise cease to exist); it's this respons that probably shifted the powers to offer me a more protocol oriented gig, or so I thought... The 'governance' hyper object turned out tom be pretty salient and drew asymetric amounts of attention away form the words 'ledger' and 'coordinator'; ones which I took as the contextual framing. 

Lets ground this in [Pospis post](https://pospi.spadgos.com/2022/07/04/blockchain-regen-permaculture-and-white-supremacism/) before continuing; there was a short articulation about supremacy symptoms that raised a few introspective inquiries for me, and man, when grounded in the arc I've just lived through they are anything but simple (infact somewhat paradoxical). Here's the paragraph that drew reflections:

> White Supremacy operates in subtle, nuanced ways. When you look into [how people of colour diagnose the condition](https://www.whitesupremacyculture.info/characteristics.html), you'll find a bunch of symptoms which don't appear to have much to do with those extreme pictures of hatred and racial oppression at all. They are things like "unclear power", "siloing", "sense of urgency" and "fear of open conflict". They're cultural preconditions which allow the status quo to flourish, and for non-White voices to be silenced in the process.

#### Introspections
Damn, placed into context this paragraph shone a light on some shadows; I hope "we" (myself and leadership at the Regen foundations) can learn from and understand our experiences. 

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not particularly educated matters of race, growing up in Ireland (under exposed) and the London (extreamly exposed) I've just considered humans as messy in general and that there are much more meaningful distinctions than skin colour - though I do recognise that threatened or persecuted identities galvanise into classes and creeds for a sense of belonging and mutual support. 

Reading through the criterea listed on the white supremecy culture I immediatly spot a number of my own short comings and while I can acknowlege them in myself, though I also note the paradox in how these criterea are often politically weaponised as 'objective criterea' (rather than dynamic values that need to be contextually regulated). Reading past the salient image which draws out my critical faculties, I'm suprised to find that the author does an excellent job of explicitly pleading readers not to worship or weaponise their written words. 

So yeah, what are these short comings I can see in myself? Well I've been accused of 'objectivity' because I don't believe in nilistic subjectivity/romanticism/relitivity... which is in my opinion an eiter/or false dichotomy as the accusation discounts lived intersubjective experiences; but in writing these words I'm now being defensive right? One step forward two steps back... Yes, I could have skipped this paragraph of paradoxes but there is a point here which is that we're all gonna fall short of perfection here. Pointing fingers is not the path forward and we need much greater `paradexterity` to navigate such complex and contridictaory waters or we'll unfairly come down on ourselves or others. 

#### Experience
Back to the trials and tribulations of the title I was mandated with and the internal complexities of the Regen Foundation. Daaaaammn, where to begin. I think the main story arc here is probably similar to the 'emperors new clothes'. Although I was given such a bombastic title; I was legally hired by the Regen Foundation as a consultant. 

There are rules governing how a consultant can act within an organisation, but being a proliterateriot of sorts or commoner, I don't really care much what the legislating class thinks (nor do I like their superior sense of morality) and as such I engaged with the foundation under my own agency. This was tougher than expected as initially it felt like I was placed on a pinnicle by the CEO and 'white knighted' if you will. Barf. I can't think of anything more incongruent with my sense of self. Still, those with no desire to rule are most fit to do so I rationalised to myself in order to play my role, so I played in the mud like the naked psychedelic anarchist "I am" (identity is poison).

Around the time of the fourth community call things started to get political, like really political. All of a sudden the organisational mood had moved from relaxed retreat to tense in the matter of a week. It felt like I was getting scapegoated for all manner of things which was coming on suddenly and completely out of the blue; I assumed I'd aggitated my colleges with some controversial comments or by owning my shadow too publically (i.e. I admitted feeling illigetimate in my role etc.). The spanish inquisition had arrive and I was on trial... I had no idea for what but it seemed pretty related to my title and skin tone given the questions. My lack of apoligism seemed to aggitate the matter further, I can see inequity but since I don't activly try to perpetuate it I carry little guilt. 

I had no idea what was going on other than political policing and much venom spitting which I did my best to eat and avoid engaging with too deeply (it was hard to maintain my integrity in these interactions and in all honestly I can't say that I fully managed). In a matter of a week or so I'd gone from the pinnacle to the pit; from facillitator to facillitated and so forth. 

A college then asked me to take a call with a community member they'd been in dialogue with so I got on the call and encountered a very political young lady. As there was a strong energetic impulse present the interaction felt much akin to an interview with a predetermined outcome. I needed a walk to discharge the energy I'd absorbed from this exchange but it seemed I'd passed the test to a sufficient degree by listening fully while not adding fuel to the fire. 

This exchange however clarified to me where such an uncomfortable transmission was coming from; my collegues had probably been engaging with this party and growing a relationship with them for some time (assuming positive intentions). My diagnosis of the situation was that they were being moved through weaponised ideology. Not much to be done other than first hand learning, go with the flow. 

However it would seem that the double bind of these impossible standards were soon to be imposed upon me as I was being being hung out to dry for unclear powerstructures (calls for 'governance') and told to codify organisational structures as written word. Both of these 'governance' issues were completely out of my remit as ledger gov coordinator so I pushed back, but no matter how often I tried to clarify this I was no longer being listened to; communication had become futile. Perhaps this is why?:

> These altercations typically unfold in predictable patterns. First the White person will express shock and sadness that the harm has occurred. Then they will assert that they are trying their best. Both of these behaviours center the voice of the oppressor (yes, in this case it's you- the White person) and move to expect consideration and sympathy from the oppressed (non-White) person. In the process, the marginalised voice is pushed back out of the limelight and White feelings become the most important matter to be addressed.

At this point I need to acknowlege that this is my own voice and testimony as it centers attention on my voice. But does my skin colour automatically put me in the wrong? As the precarious consultant in an altercation with an ethnic CEO I wonder if I'm still the opressor given the asymetry of legal power? I'll also check my privilage at this point and suggest that noominal power perhaps levels the playing field? 

By venting about all this, I wonder if this is this me playing the victim? By acknowleging this am I just being premptivly defensive or mindfully reflective? Why am I even writing this? Am I just trying to justify myself clear my conscience? At this point it would seem so right?

Assuming a false dichotomy of 'good guys' and 'bad guys', and that both will typically of think themselves the in 'the right' - then I suppose I might as well get to the end of my testimony and let who evers reading this weight the values and decide...

Things started to quieten down as the team went out 'on tour' attending conferences and such. The socialisation and professional development budget was pretty unevenly distributed, the CEO going to numerous engagements and flying to lots of places, with the rest of the team (bar Gijs) attending at least one event I felt compelled to attend one myself.

Shortly after this I was put in 'remediation', I was told that I should not claim compensation for my travels yet since I was on work time, I was demanded to objectify the people I met by putting them in a silo'd CRM (notion), remove the write up I'd put on github and hand these contacts over to uncaring reception. This is not how I like to handle relationships but was consequentially told that I'd only get paid if I followed 'remediation' orders, which we're in my opinion extreamly colonialist. I couldn't comply in good faith so tidyed up loose ends - a twitter space I sorted out for a college that was on holiday - while working under the sword of damaclese and then resigned. 

Seven months work, no holiday, no expenses. A CEO treating me in such a manner was not a paycheck worth fighting for. I closed things out with a free exit interview framed by the CEOs chosen HR rep; who asked very shallow and inconsequential questions copyed from the internet (her testimony!). 

Still to this day, I don't know what I did and was not presented with charges that made any sense (imposing etymology was one!?!). Regardless I've apoligised to the CEO as I take responsibility for a sense of bitterness throughout this process; I wish I could have done it whistling and smiling but I couldn't. It was an abrasive experience and I felt a significant loss and sacrifice in my resignation. 

#### Reflections
How do I feel now though? Clear from writing this now that I've recovered the energy to decscibe such a mess; my paraphrasing the remidiation doc was part of it's requirements but I honestly saw it as labour outsourcing so did not comply. While I don't feel that I owe this emotional labour to anyone, it has felt like necessary therepy. 

So yeah, back to the post which seemingly prompted this out pouring; what was actually going on here? Well from Pospis post (and the origin the twitter account) I can infer some blind spots and now reckon that the CEO was probably caught in a multi polar trap between staff and community. My sense is that this was probably intergenerational trauma getting pushed upstream onto those with more processing capacity (i.e. myself) through the CEO as conduit. She has my empathy. 

If my speculative inference is correct then the symptoms listed in the supremecy link were essentially weaponised and leveraged against the CEO by another ethnic communty member. The CEO then buckled under the political pressure and did her best to remedy her discomfort (as we all do in these situations).

Since she couldn't directly push back on the community member for risk of a blow up and PR nightmare (fear of impacting the foundations reputation), she complied by folding to the political pressure by perpetuating this violence onto myself. My guess is that sadly this was due to result in a loose loose scenario as the foundation could never reach the perfection of ideals, cansequentially the community member couldn't outsource the totality of their trauma (inhereted from their local context), while I was put in a position where the only path forward was to resign... 

Causality is of course exceptionally hard to pin down but I feel this a relevant perspectiove. This is work I'm doing for myself and others and so I gain from these experiences, even when I loose, only compassion remains for all parties involved.
