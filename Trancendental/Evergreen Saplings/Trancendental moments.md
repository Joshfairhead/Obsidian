# Trancendental moments

Practice emotions daily. Intentionally learn what the descriptor feels like and deepen the capacity to articulate them. Figure out a system.
 
 Instead of asking myself how to best follow a conversation, figure out how to best have a conversation. Not how to respond, but how to act and interact. Especially when others are not playing the same game. What kind of how matters, even if "how" is the active modality or metaphysical priority. Whats the field of action there?
 
 Does life cycle through moments of immanence, omnicience and transience? e.g. Majas visit; the immediacy of the initial landing, an illegible detachment process followed by meditation, reconcillitation and pleasent good byes... and a transcendental spliff in the park leading to nates and insights. Can knowing this pattern lead to fourness?
 
 Can an article be written using this pattern of upscaling through the systems?
 
Why? How? What? 9, 3, 6.
Art, Science, Technology. 9, 3, 6.
Metaphysics, Science, Technology. 9, 3, 6.
Artefacts are created from technology. Thus metaphysics is art. Or of artistic nature and vice-a-versa.

Can a commentary be made on the above? Can this be expanded from the perspective of fourness?

Game rules for triples; match a three pair or run. Metaphyiscal poker. Especially multi-dimensional if if other combinations are extended. How many patterns can you see in your hand, and what about speculating on the hands of other players?  

What is the triad of qualsystems? 369 is probably 369. Dynamism, Coalescence, Transformation.

- The six laws of three seems to correspond to the six connectives of four. Does this function as a checksum? [[Qual Systems]] [[H3uni]]
- [[Triads]] Hopes wishes desires

- In online communication there is always room for interjection through threaded replies. In face to face communications this space does not exist. When using computers regurly, perhaps its possible to get too used to this, leading to uncalibrated interaction. Measurements may be overly sharp, under emphasised or badly timed. 
- Being part of an ingroup for too long may also have the same effect. You might get too familliar with the language and loose an ability to communicate in the common tongue. 
- Learning tools to build tools; the process of transformation
- Quantum Realms; actuality, possibility, probability
