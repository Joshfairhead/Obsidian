# Take Notes To Capture Insight

This note is in itself an insight. I just captured it. While previously using Roam Research my graph ended up fragmented because I was capturing pretty much anything as a node. Previously they were too tightly scoped; for instance [[Rust]] contains all I need to dive into learning the language, however it's not useful in creating a line of thought that I can tug on to magically produce artifacts.  

Still, I like to have such nicely curated intelligance for obvious reasons... but it doesn't fit with the [[Evergreen Notes]] framework very well. As such, I've partitioned my data into a couple of folders to still make use of this system - while integrating my older notes. 

I'm playing with a few attractor folders; the immanent, omnicient and trancendental. The notes that I referred to as "intelligence" are clearly of the omnicient modality so thats where they now live. 

The [[Evergreen Notes]] pattern feels like its more insight based, making it of the trancendental modality - so they now live in that folder (with subfolders for stages of growth). The immanent folder is my workspace where daily notes and artifacts from tasks or projects pile up into various subfolders.

To take care of my Roam notes and file them, I've created another two folders called "Monad Forrest" and "Monad Seeds" as they are reductive. These folders are for "intelligance" or raw "data"... I'm never going to write an article about an organisation I'm tracking but such information is still useful to have.

As such I speculate that [[A good note taking system should have levels of scale]]. Just like [[Qual Systems]] perhaps?
