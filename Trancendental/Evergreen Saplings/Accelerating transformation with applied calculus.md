# Accelerating transformation with applied calculus 

Have you realised that there seems to be a monopoly on truth? If you've ever spent time outside the system, dissented from the status quo or come up against the edges of the social contract - you may have discovered that for the largest part 'culture is not your friend (my friend)'. This provokative quote is meerly intend to point out that the rigid standards and protocols of the gatekeepers serve to preserve established interests. 

This is fine and is not to say that they serve no purpose, they do, they hold space. However the preservation of established standards are not what we need to be discussing. Such cannoical reference points for truth claims and social norms are great as a means of simplifying the world and making it legible for our scared monkey minds - but they are built on quick sand. 

The real world is mysterious, messy and monsterously chaotic - while the old gaurd of goverment, acedemia and industry are conservitive, risk adverse and complicated. This is problematic.

I'm asserting that the risks of non-action are high as humanity could easily loose the benefits we've accumulated thus far - by which I mean that we are now facing unprecedented amounts of whats often called x-risk. Consequentially were in a double bind; both mentalities of 'move fast and break thing' AND 'move slowly and fix things' are flawed. 

We need deliberate, iterative and fluid transformation. The institutional gatekeepers are not going to help here. We need justice through optionality (pick a flavour; climate, social, economic etc.)!

### Bottlenecks
Lets get real. We need in context specific solutions. Global problems need a plurality of local solutions. How do we enable local solutions though? Especially since the decks staked in favour of those with access to capital and other privilages! Mmmm, we might need to get more specific. 

Lets look at the voluntary carbon market as an example. Centralised gatekeepers like Verra put standards in place that are often out of reach for the small fish. They usually need more land or capital in order to participate or its access denied because these top down entities dictate the terms. 

While this is to be expected due to bandwidth and capacity constraints, these are the people we need to include. Ignoring the long tail is both unjust and unpragmatic because its where 70% of our transformation potential comes from. Centralisation is a bottle neck. We need to provide these folk more accessible pathways. But how?

### Gatekeepers
- Industry (+)
- Goverment (=)
- Academia (-)

#### Constraints 
- Legitimacy (+)
- Curation (=)
- Funding (-)

### Pathways
- Growth (+)
- Innovation (=)
- Expertise (-)



#### Monad of Enablers /Constraints
- Curation 
- Peer review
- Legitimacy
- Expertice 
- Legibility
- Funding
- Scale


- Instutional demands for legibility holds back and distorts scientific progress by imposing a top down criterea on bottom up emergent problems.
- Prioritisation of scale at the expense of the long tail
- This ungrounded view of the world results in both funding asymmetries and unintended consequences. 
- Centralised registries prioritise scale at the expense of small holders; a long tail who in aggrigate unlock much more value in the world.
	- Centralised planning and the need for legibility ultimatly creates a dissociated world view with contextual asymmetries which result in unintended consequences.
