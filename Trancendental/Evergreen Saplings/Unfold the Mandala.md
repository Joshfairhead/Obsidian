Understanding is the byproduct of reason. To effectivly understand eachother, we must convey our reasoning. The most structured form of reason is geometric in form, holding the potential for maximum syntropy. Thus, reasoned geometrical diagrams are the highest bandwith channel through which to convey and converge on understanding. 

Structured diagrammatic reasoning also shapes our `internal geometry` as a result of process. Mental associations become more closely related making the intention more precice and consistent. This can lead to more effective action and understanding - aka better [[governance]].
