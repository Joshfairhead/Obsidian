    - The AN stage is somewhat autistic, driven by animalistic needs of survival. **A:** The life problems faced are an imperative need for the periodic physiological needs. **N:** The coping mechanism is thus attunement to the processing of relevant information, responding only to a felt intensity of the need. Learning is habitual.
    - The BO stage revolves around a tribalistic existence. **B:** The need for safety, security and assurance are dominant concerns. **O:** The organism is attuned to aperiodic physiological needs like shelter and security. Learning is pavlovian.
    - The CP stage is egocentric, volatile and propelled by life conditions of **C:** boredom and an elder dominated life. **P:** Sense and self consciousness emerge with a capacity to experience shame as the organism grows weary of constraint and begins to throw caution to the wind. Learning is operant and instrumental.
    - The DQ stage is moralistic, absolutist and prescriptive. **D:** The haves vs have nots, are apparent and increased sense of self and others along with an awareness of death brings discomfort. **Q:** Coping mechanisims that emerge are avoidant learning, guilt, deferral of gratification, control of impulses and a naive sense of rationality. Learning is through avoidance conditioning.
    - The ER stage brings a materialistic existence. Carpe Diem. **E: **A sense of existential anguish, drives a more calculating self expression that strives for success and life's finer offerings. **R: **The emergent coping mechanisms are dispassionate, objective, hypothetico-deductive or scientific thinking that rejects moralistic-prescription. The organism learns through expectancy.
    - The FS stage is personal and sociocratic. **F: **The organism is faced with issues coming to peace in aloneness, with ones innerself and others. **S: **The emergent coping mechanisims represents truly experiencing the subjective feelings of humankind. Learning is immersive and operational.
    - The GT stage is systemic and multidimensional in perspective attuned to existential problems. **G:** Life conditions are encompassing and takes threats to the survival of organismic life seriously. **T:** Emergent coping mechanisims are similar to N in that there is an attunement to relevant information only, however instead of being centered around individual survival needs its focused at the collective level.
    - The HU stage is intuitive and existentialist in nature. **H: **Life conditions involves a recognition of mystery; how much one will never know about existence and that a problem solving existence is not enough. **U:** Emergent coping mechanisims are essentially the same as O, but instead of a local focus on aperiodic physiological needs like shelter and safety, they focus on global ones.

    - When it's interpreted as such we do the work a disservice and debase its underlying value through epistemic trespassing. Speaking the grammar is not enough; its about doing the work. Perhaps this observed reification is all aspirational though? Maybe some good things will come out of it.
    -  for understanding the traits of personal, cognitive and organisational development. Unfortunately what I perceive as the original intention tends to get distorted, the surface level becoming enshrined as gospel without contemplation or reflection. Its deeper than a labels or categories.
    - Naturally, this form of epistemic trespassing misappropriates ideas and debases the language. Perhaps its all aspirational though? From my perspective, models like spiral dynamics can't be properly understood or even discussed without doing the personal work required to understand them. Don't fool yourself, bio-psycho-social upgrades are an expensive process. Knowing some labels and speaking a grammar is not enough.
- Cut warning on the levels
    - As mentioned __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ is pretty much the essence of __Spiral Dynamics __but__ __a ⚠️WARNING!⚠️ about how the latter is often interpreted is probably abaut due - at least the easily accessible articles and videos on the internet. Groups often overestimate themselves and get hung up on the levels, idealise and weaponise them (e.g. Antifa); the [Dunning Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) is real and this is the mountain of immaturity. If you wish to reify this stuff please do some in depth research and make sure to read the damn books! **This article is not sufficient.**

    - The previously developed [R] based coping mechanisms still dominate as adreneline levels begin to drop, which is predominantly one of materialism and instumentalisation. In other words, when dealing with the existential conditions of [F], coping mechanisms developed at the previous state [R] are still quite dominant and such behaviors only serve to sabotage ones goals!

    - ## Conclusion
        - Regardless of which labeling system you prefer; memes, colours or letters - we can see a patterned interaction between interior and exterior domains and a fluctuation between levels of concern.
        - Obviously this all has implications at the group level also, which would ultimatly result in a much more verbose essay. Ethical concerns also radically increase the complexity:
        - __Damn it all, a person has the right to be who he is - Clare Graves__
        - But of course this espoused perspective is perhaps overly simplistic and has contextual dependancies. He actually covers a lot of ground regarding appropriate interventions as well as makes the statement:
        - The serious problem that man has is getting mankind, the rest of mankind, as much of mankind as he can, above the ER level of existence. Can we afford to have anyone sitting around strumming his fiddle?
        - So, its not a simple affair. The spirit of the first statement is definatly worth meditating on, rather than taking the wording as literal - which would be a [D-Q] fallacy after all - however, not considering such would be ethical neglect. In this instance right and wrong is pretty contextual.

    - ## Introduction
        - There's an increasing sea of noise on the internet around __"Spiral Dynamics" __as it gains in popularity throughout emergent organisations and extitutional networks. However, a lot of the discourse appears focused on reifying the stages of development which are simply useful conceptions. Please don't make typologies your church, trust in **the process** instead!
        - Let's start at the beginning with a corpus of research conducted by Dr. Clare Graves which was originally known as __Emergent Cyclical Theory; __work which now forms the foundation of whats come to be known as __Spiral Dynamics, __but perhaps has more to say than many proponents of the latter often appreciate__.__
        - Graves' work actually came remarkably close to remaining buried. It's reported that at some point during the mid 1950's that Graves witnessed his colleague Abraham Maslow unceremoniously "torn to pieces" by colleagues at an APA seminar. Upon finding his friend distraught in the hotel lobby, Graves vowed not to put himself in a similar position until he could adequately defend his own position. Much of the work was subsequently abandoned and his book remained unpublished until after his death, before getting posthumously pieced back together again by peers and archivists through his articles, transcripts and seminars.
        - The research, however, stands tall on its own merits and provides the groundwork for an evidence based meta-model about the psychological development of our species–one that's capable of integrating many of the theorists that came before and after it's time. We'll touch on some of these as we go but just to note, this article is primarily about the foundations he laid for others.
        - __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ is thus an undeniably a useful study, however let's endeavor to remain aware that the map is NOT the territory; just a useful lens for examining our psychological makeup at both the individual and collective levels.
        - This work thus helps explain a wide variety of phenomena such as humanities historical progress, organisational/national developments as well as provide a compass for systemic interventions... while also hinting towards what our future may eventually bring!
        - Let's get comfortable with the theories history and evidence, acclimatise to the base conceptions of psychology the work surfaced, examine these conceptions to reveal how they are useful and finally get to grips with the unfolding generative process itself.
    - ## An Open Inquiry
        - As mentioned, __Spiral Dynamics__ is born out of the work on __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ which was originally conducted during the early 1950's. Unlike many conjectures this work is evidence based and established through years of empirical data collection–rather than formed from an initial set of assumptions and retrofit to an arbitrary hypothesis.
        - One of the most salient parts of Graves work is that it considers the human condition as __open-ended__** **with no final state of enlightenment, self-actualization or nirvana. These 'states' may indeed exist, its just that the evidence seems to favor an endless search for order in a chaotic universe **without finality**. Even the better known Abraham Maslow embraced this __open-ended__ view despite common interpretations of his work:
        - You should know that Maslow came around to my point of view. If you look at his later writings you will see that he accepted both the cyclic idea that there is more than one kind of expressive system and more than one kind of belonging system, and the system is open ended. We finally, after fighting this over for eight years, came to a fundamental agreement along that line. - Graves ([Lee, 2002,  p. 52](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Human-Existence-Clare-Graves/dp/097247420X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Levels+of+Human+Existence&qid=1619128459&s=books&sr=1-1))
        - The essence of Graves work is that humans develop new bio-psycho-social coping mechanisms to deal with existential problems, and these emergent coping mechanisms arise in response to an [increasingly complex environment](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile). As the tide of human progress rises [exponentially](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), it thus seems likely that we'll begin to encounter more Buddahs about. Or face existential ruin... [[BreakDownOrBreakThrough]]
        - ⚠️ Now, for those who have already done a degree of reading around __Spiral Dynamics, __or __Ken Wilber etc__,__ __please do your best NOT to draw comparisons just yet. Try to sit back, defocalise and enfold yourself into __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ with beginners eyes. These works are all indeed very similar and also related but we're deliberately avoiding an explanation of the categories until the second part of this article. This is mainly to establish background and avoid the fallacy of **interpreting this work as a simple typology**–a trap many articles and readers walk straight into! ⚠️
    - ### Background
        - ![](https://notablog.joshafairhead.com/content/images/2021/02/PlatoArtistotle.jpg)
        - In the early 1950's Graves held a position as a psychology professor at Union College NY where a student of his posited the following question: from all the competing psychological theorists, who's model was ultimately correct? With no immediate answer to hand, and a monkey on his back, Graves could only collect the required data to find out!
        - **He began with the following lines of inquiry:**
            - Can one provide evidence that conflict and contradiction, confusion and controversy are represented in conceptions of psychological health?
            - What are the conceptions of psychological health existing in the minds of biologically mature human beings?
            - Do the concepts which exist suggest that psychological health should be viewed (a) as a state or condition, or (b) as a **psychological process?**
            - What is the essential nature of psychological health if it is a state or condition?
            - What is the nature of the **process** of psychological health if the basic research indicates that it should be viewed thus?
        - **These drivers were then further expanded into research questions in order to generate relevant data:**
            - How do biologically mature human beings conceive of 'what is the healthy personality'?
            - Do biologically mature humans have, basically, one major identifiable conception of what the psychologically healthy adult is?
            - Do biologically mature humans have more than one conception of what a healthy personality is?
            - If adults have several conceptions of healthy personality, are the conceptions classifiable into groups of similar conceptions?
            - If the various conceptions are classifiable, how can they be classified? 	a. by content?	b. structurally? 	c. functionally?
            - Will there be evidence that a singular conception of healthy personality stands out as superior to other conceptions?
        - **The primary issue surmised: **
        - __What will be the nature and character of conceptions of psychological health of biologically mature human beings who are intelligent, but relatively unsophisticated in psychological knowledge in general, and in personality theory in particular?__
    - ### Phase 1: collecting primary data
        - When Graves began his investigation he was working in three schools. One all male, another all female and the last was a mixed adult extension division. Over the course of his investigation he studied a relatively diverse group of about 1,065 subjects aged 18-61.
        - He needed 'representative' subjects for the purposes of his study; which he found in his relatively unsophisticated first year students who were enrolled on his "Theory of Normal Psychology" program. The classroom became his laboratory and he taught in 'novel' ways to accommodate his study. His methodology was applied to eight sets of students, eight different times in order to generate his primary data.
        - Upon starting his lectures, he told his students not to read a single thing on psychology for the first five classes. The time was to be spent discussing what one might put into a conception of healthy personality and a personal conception was to be presented in a paper at the end of the five weeks.
        - In the second five weeks, students were split into random groups and instructed to present their own conception to their peers and receive criticism. Graves observed their reactions and behaviors as their peers "went after them". At the end of these five weeks students were to write up a defense or modification of their existing conception. This gave Graves a chance to observe if and how conceptions changed under peer influence.
        - The next step, was for the class to study a variety of authorities and turn in a modification of their original hypothesis. He then sat with randomly selected students to interview them about the process itself; how their conceptions might have changed and the factors that influenced them in changing their minds.
        - **This data set produced:**
            - A phenomenal set of beliefs around healthy psychology.
            - Reactions to the criticism of espoused beliefs, evidenced in observation and through paper defense and/or modification.
            - Relation to confrontation with authority as evidenced through paper defense or modification.
            - Interview data on the process of the primary experience.
        - **Through this study, a second set of research questions opened up:**
            - What will happen to a person's characterization of mature human behavior when s/he is confronted with the criticism of his/her point of view by peers who have also developed their own conception of psychologically mature behavior?
            - What will happen to a person's conception of mature human behavior when confronted with the task of comparing and contrasting his/her conception of psychologically mature human personality to those conceptions which have been developed by authorities in the field?
            - How will the subjects behave under peer criticism?
    - ### Phase 2: classification
        - Each year an external panel of judges were instructed to classify the data into categories. This was blindly repeated with a second panel of judges.
        - **The data fell into two primary categories:**
            - Express self
            - Deny self
        - As these categories emerged each year (unknown to the panel) the research turned into a process of accumulation. Over 8 years, sub-categories also began to emerge in about 60% of the data. This data was later augmented and interpreted through research in **phase four. **The primary categories and their basic traits are as follows:
            - Deny self:	a) sacrificially - Aka [BO].	b) for deferred reward - Aka [DQ].	c) for acceptance now - Aka [FS].
            - Express self:	a) as self desires in a calculating fashion, at the expense of others - Aka [ER].	b) as self desires but not at the expense of others - Aka [GT].
    - ### Phase 3: inter-actions
        - This was probably **the most interesting phase** as it would reveal a good deal of data about the basic nature of human behavior. **It's also is where things started to become more complex!**
        - With formalised classifications, Graves was now able to study his accumulated data and observations in depth. The first task was to study the conceptions in relation to peer criticism; the extent of peer influence, changing under this influence, acting with peers and defense/modification of ones conceptions.
        - The second task was to study the conceptions in relation to criticism, in relation to authority, and finally peer interaction observations.
        - **Similarities in levels:**• Sacrificial levels** **were responsive to external conditions. They saw denial of self as the answer to their existential conditions.
        - **• **Expressive levels were not responsive to external conditions, but would move into deny-self modalities when "central change" (movement to other levels) occurred.
        - **Differences between sacrificial levels:**The [DQ] and [FS] classifications were NOT alike in terms of effective change forces. The [DQ] category would only respond to an accepted higher authority and NOT their peers; they would remain rigid otherwise and defend their original conceptions to the last. The [FS] category would only respond to peer authority. The two classifications were NOT alike either in terms of their perceived freedom to behave.
        - **Differences between expressive levels:**The [ER] and [GT] classifications were also NOT alike in terms of effective change forces. The former group would change only through self procured sources, while the latter responded regardless of where thought or information came from.
        - The two categories were NOT alike in terms of perceived freedom of behavior either. The [ER] stages __"always expressed themselves as if tethers were on them, always tying them down" __with a seemingly desperate need for freedom! The Latter [GT] stages didn't feel bound by the goals of someone else and were generally non-argumentative–though they would speak up about perceived mistakes in direction.
        - **Group Work:**Students with the same conceptions of psychological maturity were grouped into classes and tasked with a specific problem. These subjects were then left to autonomously form groups and students with a...
        - • [DQ] conception split up into feudalistic units, each with separate leaders. • [ER] conception had a huge argument, with one eventual leader emerging. • [FS]  conception worked well on their own without a leader.• [GT] conception chose the most appropriate leader for the task at hand, later to drop them for someone better suited to the next task.
    - ### Phase 4; sense-making
        - The last phase was spent making sense of the data through research and factoring in world views from other cultures and walks of life, such as indigenous people.
        - It was also around this time that a new categories started to emerge; the [HU]** **and [CP]** **conceptions. Until this point it seemed as if there was indeed a final state [GT] to psychological maturity... but a number of people with this conception – otherwise deemed as 'self-actualising' or 'fully functioning' etc.–began to reject their own views. Initially this strange contradiction shook Graves work at its foundations... before paving the way for the conception of psychological health to be seen as a **process**.
        - Shortly after this anomaly of self-dissent a missing link showed up and opened new passageways. People from lower classes started to gain access to higher education and it became evident that an earlier sub-category had been missed out; the merciless 'express self at all costs' or [CP] modality who expressed a 'law of the jungle' mindset where 'might is right'. This was the most primordial data that Graves himself empirically collected, but the categories [AN] & [BO] we're later added through academic investigation into non-industrial cultures.
        - The **process** hypothesis suddenly became validated as people at [CP] started to change their conceptions - low and behold - into to the [DQ] category of 'deny self for later reward'! The issue of [FS]** **subjects** **denying their own prior conceptions was thus resolved; they had undergone central change and were thus starting to embrace an unconceived** **modality [HU]. This is as far as Graves data went, but he and a number of others believed that it wasn't the end of the journey!
    - ## The Dialectical Ladder
        - Ok, so that's that's a primer on the history of Graves' data and research. Although the classifications were marked, they are probably quite fuzzy still. As mentioned, this is because we've intentionally been reviewing the history of how the various conceptions were uncovered before exploring typologies. Let's now get a better handle on these in order to eventually elicit insights.
        - In __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ the conceptions are referred to by letter pairings rather than colours or memes which were later added by [Don Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck) and Christopher Cohen in __Spiral dynamics__.
        - The first set [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H] refer to the existential conditions, while the second set [N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U] refer to the emergent coping mechanisms. Here's a relatively detailed chart for better resolution:
        - ![](https://notablog.joshafairhead.com/content/images/2021/04/Chart-1.png)
        - Whats particularly interesting about these classifications is the generative dialectic between **means and end**. In much of 'Spiral Land' this interaction is overlooked–yet it's probably the most interesting part! **This dialectic is the difference between aspiration and embodied action. **
        - It seems apparent here that the 'aspirational means' are thus defined by deficiency or craving. This is where the 'Spiral colours/memes' can become very misleading as it's only during the second half of the process that they actually manifest! Consequentially, we're perhaps better off inverting them and considering such labels to be anti-memes (Spiral colours now added for comparative reference):
        - __ __**[AN] Beige: **lacks basic subsistence. **[BO] Purple:** lacks safety.**[CP] Red:** lacks power and excitement.**[DQ] Blue:** lacks stability and purpose.**[ER] Orange:** lacks material success.**[FS] Green:** lacks community and human bond.**[GT] Yellow:** lacks existential acceptance.**[HU] Turquoise: **lacks** **experiential communion.
        - The key insight here is that__ __existential conditions come a priori to what Graves termed emergent coping mechanisms which arise **later** **in response** through an unfolding generative process!
    - ### Generative Friction
        - As one might imagine, there can be quite a tension between existential conditions and the formation of emergent coping mechanisms. This friction is perhaps akin to the myth of [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) pushing a boulder uphill for all of eternity? Once a local maxima is reached in this open ended system the boulder rolls back down to a new local minima, and once again we begin work on our next existential challenge!
        - ![](https://notablog.joshafairhead.com/content/images/2021/04/sysiphusart.jpg)
        - Having familiarised ourselves with the various psychological conceptions and the structural coupling which occurs between actor and environment, the most interesting questions are: what happens during this generative process of transformation? and how do such psychological phase shifts actually occur?
        - Lets zoom in on the process:
            - **Potential**The necessary higher level structures must be present within the organism. At the individual level Graves saw these as neurological systems within the brain but further resolution on this matter has remained elusive for me. [Dąbrowski's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration#Development_potential) work may be relevant here however; he points to the factors of over-excitability, capabilities and drive for autonomy as significant factors in the development of an independent personality. At the organisational level, we might speculate that this potential could be represented by the variety of people, values, coordination protocols and mimetics available within the group.
            - **Resolution of existential problems**Stages of expanding (and contracting) awareness cannot be skipped or spiritually bypassed. Problems faced at earlier levels of existence must be resolved in order to release psychic energy for advancement. First things first!
            - **Feeling of dissonance**A breakdown in the solution of current existential problems MUST be faced along with a period of crisis and regression. This situational dissonance is required to catalyse biochemical changes, which then drives a regressive search for old patterns of behavior in order to re-establish a previous apparent solution to the existential crises. Such a search is doomed to end in arrestment, regression or growth because the old solutions to former problems do not apply any better than the way of life whose inadequacy triggered the search in the first place. A bifurcation of values is required.
            - **Gaining of insights**What puts an end to the regressive search and unlocks the formation of new structures, propelling an evolution into the next modality is insight. This insight MUST enable the organism to solve the new problems at hand.
            - **Removal of barriers**When such an insight is reached, few in the environment will share the same insight and thus the barriers of friends, family, processes etc. must be overcome or ignored to make such a leap.
            - **Opportunity to consolidate**The last necessary condition for the emergence of new structures is the consolidation factor which comes into play as the organism begins to practice and affirm the new behavior. Here the implementation of insights are being accomplished.
    - ### Engaging with transformation
        - To ground the above process slightly; lets zoom-in on a specific transformation at a specific stage:
        - Once the [ER] transition has been completed and our perception of material success has been achieved, a longing for community arise out of the new conditions [F]. However at this point the coping mechanisms to fulfill a desire for deep interpersonal connection [S] are still nascent and the organism is still likely utilising prior learned behaviors from the previous modality [R]. Thus, once again the boulder needs to be pushed uphill from this new local minama to cultivate new capabilities. When such abilities are developed and we become centered in the deny-self modality [S], we're approximately halfway through the transformation process. If the conditions permit, we can quite happily remain centered here at [FS].
        - However, once a sense of situational dissonance eventually creeps in we are biologically wired to keep pushing towards the next local maxima and deal with the existential conditions of [G]. At this point the personality once again embarks on an involution cycle in search of new insight; in this particular case the acceptance of an existential self, as opposed to externally seeking validation from a group of peers (the conception of [F] which has already been overcome).
        - In this individuation process, it would seem that we require a degree of distance from many of those around us and time to integrate the new personal practices. At these bifurcation points we're practically always caught in an intractable double bind and until we recognise such to can cope with such dilemmas, our behavior is quite likely to remain arrested!
        - So, how can we accurately judge the appropriate actions to take in a given context to enable both ourselves and others dealing with transition? Perhaps the first key is to accurately diagnose the terrain we're traversing, figure out whats needed and/or desired and then choose to privilege an appropriate schema that enables us to overcome obstacles in our way.
        - **Different conceptions will require different approaches:**In most modern cultures, the [AN] and [BO] stages are usually toddlers. Learning is through habituation and [Pavlovian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) conditioning; an associative linear processes where stimulus provokes response. The classic example is your dog drooling when dinner is getting prepared but also applies in large to dementia and substance addiction (e.g. heroin). For power hungry delinquents at the [CP] stage, benevolent autocracy is often warranted. Given freedom, these people will absorb as much space as possible while openly fleecing others of their agency; if you give an inch, they'll take a mile. Graves references [B.F. Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner),** **[August Aichhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Aichhorn)** **and** **[Kurt Eisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_R._Eissler) as relevant approaches stating that __"you put this person in a __[__box__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber)__ psychologically and you don't let him out. You've got to know and accept those rules!"__
        - Working with the [DQ] stage Graves suggests [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) is the pretty much the only person who ever had a clue. These subjects need gentle hand holding and a personal relationship in order to overcome their fears, break down unhelpful positions and get to trust–moving along at a snails pace to lead them out of themselves from there on after. These people need to see the intervenor as an authority figure in an acceptable form or they won't budge an inch–at least according to the data.
        - The [ER]** **modalities gain insight only from what they can procure for themselves, gauging their expectations against outcomes. In this regard [encounter groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-groups), where people gather to express felt experiences arising out of personal interactions are good places to gather useful feedback. Worth noting however is if the (out) group is unknown to the [ER] centered personality, they'll observe and leverage the weakness of others members to instrumentalise and manipulate other members of the group.
        - For those centered in the [FS] modality Graves held that the [Rodgerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy) approach was __"a very fine one". __Many of these methods are similar to the [ER] interventions minus the training wheels. Particular methods such as the [Rodgerean Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument) however, are considered more suitable than others. As the [FS] modality has embarked on a journey of self-exploration they are predominantly asking "why?" questions, so an authentic and congruent 1:1 relationship facilitates deeper inquiry and a shared context.
    - ### Implications
        - Obviously __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ has a wide range of implications across a number of fields particularly in government, business, healthcare, education and social science. With the right eyes, it allows us to tailor an appropriate response to the context and meet it in place with right (or deliberately wrong) action!
        - Graves work is probably also applicable to the emerging fields of artificial general intelligence, cryptocurrencies and computer science because all are simply artifacts of how we think; forms of encoded ideology. These technologies are inherently political and the tools we use WILL shape us - for better or worse.
        - How broad do you believe we are actually thinking? Are our ontologies diverse enough to fit the massive amount of variety inherent in the 'real world' or are we just over-fitting our beliefs to fool ourselves?
        - I can only encourage you to test your assumptions in an attempt to find out.
    - ## Conclusion
        - By now, it's probably apparent that this process of transformation is a pretty expensive endeavor and probably not for everyone. Is your desire for self-transcendence worth it? Are you willing to pay such a price for both personal and collective benefit? Naturally it's a personal call, but if you're not willing to walk through the gates of Hades, it's perhaps best to remain centered where you are - circumstance and aspirations permitting.
        - With that said, if you are indeed interested in peak performance and really putting in the work to taste the unknown, then learning about this framework may just help you minimise the cost of the expedition while shining a light on whats really driving yourself and others.
        - If so, during the process of such an immersion; a [situationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International) approach might be a relevant methodology. By increasing exposure to a [[Stuff/Assorted/Requisite Variety]] of experience; you'll likely be forced to update beliefs and begin to embody the ones that hold true. Just reading about Zen, Stoicism or any other spiritual practice without putting skin in the game is most likely a futile endeavor. Useful instructions for self-assembly but utterly irrelevant without expending effort.

    - ## **Introduction**
        - As a species we are extremely diverse and heterogeneous. For many of us, society can resultantly seem rife with fragmentation and contradictory views. Gazing through this kaleidoscope of word views we can observe a battlefield of ideology and competing narratives. It’s hard not to get lost in the fractal – especially as we ourselves are often to blame – because such disorder can at times feel extremely unpredictable, arbitrary and uncertain. This article is born out of a personal desire to find the order inherent in chaos; signal in the noise.
        - This artefact is thus an exposition highlighting my own investigations into the work of Clare Graves; a New York psychology professor who brought the world an evidence based meta-model known as __Emergent Cyclical Theory. __His work is salient to me because due to its broad utility it’s capable of integrating a plethora of existing theories as well as clarifying a lot of confusion around existential questions.
        - More concretely, the work is grounded in enquiry – as opposed to hypothesis – and highlights the importance of an unfolding evolutionary process rather than the static prescriptions normally found in psychological literature. Many of these theories do indeed contain grains of truth but let us momentarily pause to note that there are many castles made out of sand. It’s my belief that Graves’ work is a little bit different and can help inform a wide variety of phenomena such as the humanities, our historical progress, organisational and national developments, technology and so on – aiding in the anticipation of potential futures while simultaneously providing a lens for [systemic intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_intervention)!
        - However, while I’ll endeavour not to mislead you; please note that I’m an epistemic trespasser in these waters so please engage a degree of healthy skepticism while also doing your best to remember that “**the map is not the territory!**”
        - Diving in I’ll firstly prime you with some history and background to the theory. Secondly, I’ll expound the framework by providing more detail about the research Graves explicated. Thirdly, we’ll discuss the underlying **process** that drives the model with some reflection on its significance and potential use. Finally, I’ll add some of my own thoughts to the conclusion based on lived experience.
        - Enjoy!
        - ----
    - ## Primer
        - There's an increasing sea of noise on the internet around __"Spiral Dynamics" __as it gains in popularity throughout emergent organisations and extitutional networks. However, a lot of the discourse appears focused on reifying the stages of development which are simply useful conceptions. Please don't make typologies your church, trust in **the process** instead!
        - Let's start at the beginning with a corpus of research conducted by Dr. Clare Graves which was originally known as __Emergent Cyclical Theory; __work which now forms the foundation of what has come to be known as __Spiral Dynamics, __but perhaps has more to say than many proponents of the latter often appreciate__.__
        - __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ itself came remarkably close to remaining a buried treasure as it's reported that during the mid 1950's Graves witnessed his colleague Abraham Maslow unceremoniously "torn to pieces" by colleagues at an APA seminar. Finding his friend Maslow distraught in the hotel lobby, Graves vowed never to put himself into a similar situation until he could adequately defend his own position. Subsequently, much of his theory was abandoned and the book he was working on remained unpublished until after his death. Later it was posthumously pieced back together again by peers and archivists through his remaining articles, transcripts and seminars.
        - In my opinion this research stands tall on its own merits, provideing the groundwork for an evidence-based meta-model about the psychological development of our species – one that's capable of integrating many of the theorists who came before and after it's time. We'll touch on some of these as we go; but just to note, this article is primarily about the foundations he laid for others.
        - __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ is thus an undeniably useful study. However, let's endeavour to remain aware that the map is NOT the territory; just a useful lens for examining our psychological makeup at both the individual and collective scale.
        - This work thus helps inform a wide variety of phenomena such as the humanities, historical progress, organisational/national developments as well as providing a compass for [systemic interventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_intervention)... while also hinting towards what the future may eventually bring!
        - Let's get comfortable with the theory’s history and evidence; acclimate to the base conceptions of psychology the work surfaced; examine these conceptions to reveal how they are useful; and finally get to grips with the unfolding generative process itself.
    - ## **An Open Inquiry - essence**
        - As already mentioned, __Spiral Dynamics__ is born out of the work on __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ which was originally conducted during the early 1950's. Unlike many conjectures, this work is evidence-based and established through years of empirical data collection–rather than formed from an initial set of assumptions and retrofit to an arbitrary hypothesis.
        - __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ at one point came precariously close to remaining a buried treasure as at one point during the mid 1950's Graves witnessed his friend and colleague Abraham Maslow unceremoniously "torn to pieces" by colleagues at an APA seminar. He subsequently vowed to never put himself into a similar situation until he could adequately defend his own position. Much of his work was later abandoned out of frustration and [the book he was working on](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Ending-Quest-Explores-Treatise/dp/0972474218) remained unpublished until after his death. Only later was it posthumously pieced back together again by peers and archivists digging through his remaining articles, transcripts and seminars.
        - One of the most salient parts of this theory is that it considers the human condition as __open-ended__** **with no final state of enlightenment, self-actualization nor nirvana. These 'states' may still exist; it’s just that evidence seems to favour an endless search for order in a chaotic universe **without finality**. Even the better known Abraham Maslow embraced this __open-ended__ view despite common interpretations of his work:
        - You should know that Maslow came around to my point of view. If you look at his later writings you will see that he accepted both the cyclic idea that there is more than one kind of expressive system and more than one kind of belonging system, and the system is open ended. We finally, after fighting this over for eight years, came to a fundamental agreement along that line. - Graves ([Lee, 2002,  p. 52](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Human-Existence-Clare-Graves/dp/097247420X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Levels+of+Human+Existence&qid=1619128459&s=books&sr=1-1))
        - The essence of Graves’ work is that humans develop new bio-psycho-social coping mechanisms to deal with existential problems, and these emergent coping mechanisms arise in response to an[ increasingly complex environment](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile). As the tide of human progress rises[ exponentially](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), it thus seems likely that we'll begin to encounter more Buddhas about. Or face existential ruin... [[BreakDownOrBreakThrough]]
        - ⚠️ For those who have  done a degree of reading around __Spiral Dynamics, __or __Ken Wilbur etc__,__ __please do your best NOT to draw comparisons just yet. These works are all indeed very similar and also related but I’m deliberately avoiding discussion on these authors because they draw FROM this foundational work and conflating them may lead to confusion ⚠️
    - ### **Background - history**
        - **![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KC1XIlHI1u0LfpFxa45_ngsIBBuWgd9UZFmiMsW2ZNVaclO-fKOoAV6jo56SHlCN92hYzRiqkopR2boYYa3LL2vwrI6fd-tRQQYHU4PWFWQFqvvvRjYmc3f7rHd18PzKkVh_GSmU)**
        - In the early 1950's Graves held a position as a psychology professor at Union College NY where a student of his posited the following question: from all the competing psychological theorists, whose model was ultimately correct? With no immediate answer to hand, and a monkey on his back, Graves could only start collecting the data required to find out!
        - **He began with the following lines of inquiry:**
            - Can one provide evidence that conflict and contradiction, confusion and controversy are represented in conceptions of psychological health?
            - What are the conceptions of psychological health existing in the minds of biologically mature human beings?
            - Do the concepts which exist suggest that psychological health should be viewed (a) as a state or condition, or (b) as a **psychological process?**
            - What is the essential nature of psychological health if it is a state or condition?
            - What is the nature of the **process** of psychological health if the basic research indicates that it should be viewed thus?
        - **These drivers were then further expanded into research questions in order to generate relevant data:**
            - How do biologically mature human beings conceive of 'what is the healthy personality'?
            - Do biologically mature humans have, basically, one major identifiable conception of what the psychologically healthy adult is?
            - Do biologically mature humans have more than one conception of what a healthy personality is?
            - If adults have several conceptions of healthy personality, are the conceptions classifiable into groups of similar conceptions?
            - If the various conceptions are classifiable, how can they be classified?
                - by content?
                - structurally?
                - functionally?
            - Will there be evidence that a singular conception of healthy personality stands out as superior to other conceptions?
        - **The primary issue surmised:**
        - __What will be the nature and character of conceptions of psychological health of biologically mature human beings who are intelligent, but relatively unsophisticated in psychological knowledge in general, and in personality theory in particular?__
        - Graves then set out to conduct his research, unfolding in approximately four phases:
    - ### **Phase 1: collecting primary data**
        - When Graves began his investigation he was working in three schools. One all male, another all female and the last was a mixed adult extension division. Over the course of his investigation he studied a relatively diverse group of about 1,065 subjects aged 18-61.
        - He needed 'representative' subjects for the purposes of his study; which he found in his relatively unsophisticated first year students who were enrolled on his "Theory of Normal Psychology" program. The classroom became his laboratory and he taught in 'novel' ways to accommodate his study. His methodology was applied to eight sets of students, eight different times in order to generate his primary data.
        - Upon starting his lectures, he told his students not to read a single thing on psychology for the first five classes. The time was to be spent discussing what one might put into a conception of healthy personality and a personal conception was to be presented in a paper at the end of the five weeks.
        - In the second five weeks, students were split into random groups and instructed to present their own conception to their peers and receive criticism. Graves observed their reactions and behaviors as their peers "went after them" with critique of their espoused conception. At the end of these additional five weeks, students were to write up a defense or modification of their existing conception. This gave Graves a chance to observe if and how conceptions changed under peer influence.
        - In a third interval of five weeks, the class studied a variety of authorities and again turned in a modification of their original hypotheses. He then sat with randomly selected students to interview them about the process itself; how their conceptions might have changed and the factors that influenced them in changing their minds.
        - **This data set produced:**
            - A set of perceptual beliefs around healthy psychology.
            - Reactions to the criticism of espoused beliefs, evidenced in observation and through paper defense and/or modification.
            - Relation to confrontation with authority as evidenced through paper defense or modification.
            - Interview data on the process of the primary experience.
        - **Through this study, a second set of research questions opened up:**
            - What will happen to a person's characterization of mature human behavior when s/he is confronted with the criticism of his/her point of view by peers who have also developed their own conception of psychologically mature behavior?
            - What will happen to a person's conception of mature human behavior when confronted with the task of comparing and contrasting his/her conception of psychologically mature human personality to those conceptions which have been developed by authorities in the field?
            - How will the subjects behave under peer criticism?
    - ### **Phase 2: classification**
        - ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XbRfS-Ecqc9IBmvjtI_5v-qCvkiJw2DJeougS1SWQzBqEdac9poROVKFiWecFyQxRayHA4HL_gvxkFIWsgcSJ6n10sSevFRtwvnAG-7nF6d8oV24GRcWWUuc_W2Utl8ZTLzQQaw4)
        - **Discernment and differentiation**
        - Each year an external panel of judges were instructed to classify the data into categories. This process was then blindly repeated with a second panel of judges.
        - **The elucidated data points repeatedly collapsed into two primary categories:**
            - Express self; a mostly active form of being, predominantly driven by internal forces.
            - Deny self; a more passive form of being, largely motivated through external forces.
        - As these two categories emerged each year (unknown to the panel) the research turned into a process of accumulation. Over 8 years, sub-categories also began to emerge in about 60% of the data. This data was later augmented and interpreted through further research in **phase four **of Graves’ inquiry**. **
        - The primary categories, the labels of which will be expanded on later, and the basic traits of the participants’ conceptions are as follows:
            - Deny self:
                - sacrificially - Aka [BO].
                - for deferred reward - Aka [DQ].
                - for acceptance now - Aka [FS].
            - Express self:
                - as self desires in a calculating fashion, at the expense of others - Aka [ER].
                - as self desires but not at the expense of others - Aka [GT].
    - ### **Phase 3: sense-making and inter-actions**
        - This was probably **the most interesting phase** as it would reveal a good deal of information about how different conceptions tend to interact in the social field. **It's also where the situation began to turn into a somewhat more complex puzzle!**
        - With formalised classifications, Graves was now able to study his accumulated data and observations in depth.
            - The first task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to peer criticism as evaluated through a defense/modification of espoused conceptions; whether and how peer criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with peers in this process.
            - The second task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to authoritative criticism as evaluated through a defense/modification of espoused conceptions; whether and how authoritative criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with authority in this process.
        - By diving into these interaction patterns, the models of each conception were significantly enriched, greatly aiding the discernment process briefly outlined in phase 2. Why did it seem that there were such radical differences in the same “primary conceptions”?
        - **To recap; the similarities in the primary conceptions were:**
            - Sacrificial conceptions** **were responsive to external conditions. They saw denial of self and degrees of conformity as an answer to their existential conditions.
            - Expressive conceptions were NOT responsive to external conditions. They saw self expression as a means to overcome their existential conditions but would move into deny-self modalities when "central change" (movement to other modalities) occurred.
        - More importantly though were the differences between subjects occupying similar conceptions, particularly for enhancing resolution on the subcategories. These findings are summarised below.
        - **Differences between sacrificial conceptions:******A number of deny-self conceptions were dissimilar in terms of effective change forces. Some (the [DQ] conception) would respond only to an accepted higher authority and NOT their peers, otherwise remaining rigid and defending their initial conceptions to the last. Others however (the [FS] conception) would respond only to peer authority and NOT a perceived higher power. The two classifications were also quite dissimilar in terms of their perceived behavioural freedoms.
        - **Differences between expressive conceptions:******The express-self conceptions were also quite different in terms of effective change forces. Some (the [ER] conceptions) would change only through self procured sources, while others (the [GT] conceptions) seemed to respond regardless of where thought or information originated from.
        - These conceptions were also dissimilar in terms of perceived behavioural freedoms. Some (the [ER] conceptions) __"always expressed themselves as if tethers were on them, always tying them down"__, while others (the [GT] conception) however didn't feel bound to anything much at all - especially the goals of others. These subjects were generally non-argumentative but would often speak up about perceived mistakes.
        - **Group Work:******With increased resolution on the subcategories; students with the same conceptions of psychological maturity were grouped into classes and tasked with a specific problem. These subjects were then left to autonomously form groups and students with a...
        - • [DQ] conception split up into small feudalistic units, each with separate leaders.
        - • [ER] conception had a huge argument – with one eventual leader emerging.
        - • [FS] conception worked well on their own without a leader.
        - • [GT] conception chose the most appropriate leader for the task at hand and later to drop them for someone better suited for the next task.
    - ### **Phase 4: outliers**
        - The last phase was spent making sense of the data through research and factoring in world views from other cultures – such as indigenous people – whose walks of life were unavailable for study in Graves’ sample but whom he did not wish to overlook – possibly because it would have resulted in an immediacy bias.
        - Around this time new categories also started to emerge; until this point the available data seemed to point towards a final stage of psychological maturity... but a number of people with the ‘express self but without cost to the others’ conception began to reject their previous views! This peculiar contradiction shook Graves’ work at its foundations and for a short time causing him a great deal of confusion.
        - After these anomalies however, people from the working classes began to gain access to higher education and it became evident that an earlier sub-category had been missed out; a remorseless 'express self at all costs' modality whom appeared to espouse a 'law of the jungle' mentality, one where 'might is right'. These were the most primordial conceptions that Graves collected himself, with prior stages of cognitive evolution later uncovered through sociological research into non-industrialised cultures.
        - The subjects of this conception (‘express self at all costs’) however started to shift in their beliefs - lo and behold - into the already documented conception of 'deny self for later reward'! The earlier anomaly of certain subjects** **denying their own prior conceptions was thus resolved; they had undergone a **process **of central change and were starting to embrace a yet unconceived modality. **Subsequently**,** these findings pave the way for psychological health to be viewed as a process rather than state. **
        - [**Model man video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uq__g4ul0M)
        - This was as far Graves’ primary data went but he and a number of others believed that it wasn't the end of the journey! Given how old this research is already, with the rising complexity of our environment, we may now once again be witnessing the birth of a new conception not listed on the 1974 chart above; the [IV] modality. This is highly speculative but Graves believed it was a “__six on six”__ ladder – and it’s possible that in my own search for remarkable people I’ve already encountered such.
    - ## **The Dialectical Ladder**
        - ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dKfo8yzmpitt1WMoiCWPvXLfkgSIMbdY9UTYYvNj1cv5qOsAu5crdIbIGPv_I9Vt7jp7n8m7bq5dK_ObdXtoCP8j5BT12JUrArvhqvHxVhb_sjvj6AS_ssA683nA3Is5KkXxldMY)
        - We’ve intentionally been reviewing just the history of the research and how the conceptions were formed so far. At this point we can begin to cover the topic more generally while trying to elicit some insights. The classifications are probably still a bit unclear so let’s cover those in more depth. This is the point where the system really began to surface!
        - The first set of characters in Graves’ notation system [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H] refer to “existential conditions'' or the environment in which we inhabit. While the second set of characters [N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U] refer to what Graves termed “emergent coping mechanisms” - the capabilities we leverage to transcend our environments.
        - These emergent cycles might be thought of as a swinging pendulum where we oscillate between express-self and deny-self modalities in an unfolding process. What I find particularly interesting about the implications of Graves classifications is the generative dialectic between **environment and organism**.
        - **To me, this dialectic feels like the difference between aspiration and embodied action; **the** **environmental context gives rise to a set of needs or desires, which are then slowly manifested through a form of [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) embodied in new and novel behaviours.** **
        - ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NqXhSVVo01xchssIKVwek95PRKXfqGRTNAMvi1OwASLmSnI1o5hr1kZu-SPhq6vvWrpCYlusH-CzJ_ZBkH-uE2y6jQtWcEaXWfoREjQPsxjADUO-FsS1wdW95jRGGcMM2bD7SV8L)
        - **In contrast** to the Gravesian symbol system of letter pairings; the colours, categories and “value-memes” typically reified in __Spiral Dynamics__ and related materials seem to grossly overlook this generative interplay, reducing it into a static typing system – something that I personally find unhelpful and non-systemic. This focus on categories is a form of materialistic bias that conceptualises people as objects which in turn can give rise to cult-like behaviours where ambitious individuals weaponise the conceptions to claim authority and moral high ground.
        - Criticisms along similar lines have been raised about __Spiral Dynamics__; which in my opinion are valid due to the reductive symbol systems used, though may also be intentional for the target audience (business leaders). Nonetheless, from my perspective Graves avoids this pitfall in his own work by maintaining a focus on dialectic so I feel that he should not be tarred with the same reductive brush (or even associated with __Spiral Dynamics__, despite his foundational influence).
        - **Generative Friction**
        - As you might imagine – there can be quite a tension between existential conditions and the formation of emergent coping mechanisms. This friction is perhaps akin to the myth of[ Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) pushing a boulder uphill for all of eternity; once a local maximum is reached in this seemingly open ended system, the boulder rolls back down to a new local minimum and once again we begin work on our next existential challenge!
        - ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/C2ZW1RuGrkpsdTAFiRs2zhLHyoSheVcNQGvSNZZ7qhmdwgVyiy8QfyEiYWyPsnXsqtXCaajQtdYCDv1YHSbI7P4HVl-HD7zLPB3GlZNsWQ9a-cxTxaRNu1Olc8fHq1QVGqXmSF9c)
        - Having now acquainted ourselves with the various psychological conceptions and more importantly, **the process** of [structural coupling](https://metadesigners.org/Structural-Coupling-Glossary) which occurs between actor and environment, the most interesting questions (for me) become:
            - what actually occurs during this generative **process** of transformation?
            - and how do such bio-psycho-social phase shifts happen?
        - Lets zoom in on the transformative process:
            - **Potential******The necessary “higher order structures” must be present within the organism; at the individual level Graves saw these as neurological systems within the brain but further resolution on this matter has remained elusive in my investigations. With that said[ Dąbrowski's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration#Development_potential) work on positive disintegration may be relevant; he points to the factors of over-excitability, personal capabilities and drive for autonomy as significant factors in the development of an “independent personality”. At the organisational level, we may speculate that these structures could be represented by the variety of people, rituals, values, coordination protocols, practices and [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics) available within a group.
            - **Resolution of existential problems******Stages of expanding (and contracting) awareness cannot be skipped or bypassed. Problems faced at earlier stages of existence must be resolved in order to release psychic energy for advancement. First things first!
            - **Feeling of dissonance******A breakdown of solutions to one’s immediate existential problems MUST be faced along with a period of crisis and regression. The dissonance of this situation is required to catalyse biochemical changes that drive a regressive search for old patterns of behavior in order to establish a previous apparent solution to the situation. Such a search is certain to end in arrestment, regression or growth as old solutions to previous problems DO NOT apply to the new context any better than the way of life whose inadequacy triggered the search initially. This might be considered a form of psychological [bifurcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory).
            - **Gaining of insights******What puts an end to the regressive search and unlocks the formation of new structures, propelling an evolution into the next modality is **insight**. This insight MUST enable the organism to find an equilibrium in the immediate environment.
            - **Removal of barriers******When this insight is reached, few in the environment will share the same understanding and thus the barriers of friends, family, processes etc. must be overcome or ignored to make such a leap.
            - **Opportunity to consolidate******The last necessary condition for the emergence of new structures is a consolidation factor which comes into play as the organism begins to practice and affirm the new behavior. Here the implementation of insights are being accomplished.
        - **-------------**
        - It seems apparent here that the 'aspirational means' are thus best described by deficiency or craving. This is where the 'Spiral colours/memes' can become very misleading as it's only during the second half of the process that they actually manifest! Consequently, we're perhaps better off inverting the memes and considering such labels to be aspirational (Spiral colours now added for comparative reference):
        - **[AN] Beige: **lacks basic subsistence.
        - **[BO] Purple:** lacks safety.
        - **[CP] Red:** lacks power and excitement.
        - **[DQ] Blue:** lacks stability and purpose.
        - **[ER] Orange:** lacks material success.
        - **[FS] Green:** lacks community and human bond.
        - **[GT] Yellow:** lacks existential acceptance.
        - **[HU] Turquoise: **lacks** **experiential communion.
        - The key insight here is that__ __existential conditions come a priori to what Graves termed emergent coping mechanisms which arise **later** **in response** through an unfolding generative process!
        - --------
        - -------------
    - ### **Engaging with transformation**
        - To ground the above process slightly; lets zoom-in on a specific example of transformation at an stage thats arbitrarily chosen:
        - Once the [ER] transition has been completed and our perception of material success has been achieved, a longing for community arises out of the new conditions [F]. However at this point the coping mechanisms to fulfill a desire for deep interpersonal connection [S] are still nascent and the organism is still likely utilising prior learned behaviors from the previous modality [R]. Thus, once again the boulder needs to be pushed uphill from this new local minima as part of the process in which the organism can cultivate new capabilities. When such abilities are developed and we become centered in the deny-self modality [S], we're back in a new form of equilibrium and approximately halfway through a cycle. If the conditions permit, we can quite happily remain centered here at [FS].
        - However, once a sense of situational dissonance eventually creeps in it seems that we are biologically wired to keep pushing towards the next local maxima and to deal with the existential conditions of [G]. At this point the personality once again embarks on an involution cycle in search of new insight; in this particular case the acceptance of an existential self, as opposed to externally seeking validation from a group of peers (the conception of [F] which has already been overcome).
        - In this individuation process, it would seem that we require a degree of distance from many of those around us and time to integrate the new personal practices. At these bifurcation points we're practically always caught in an intractable double bind and until we recognise such to navigate such dilemmas, our behavior is quite likely to remain arrested!
    - ### **Engaging with transformation**
        - Having hopefully grokked the various conceptions and **the deeper process **of transformation; how do we leverage this understanding? Can it be used to help us judge appropriate actions in a given context to empower both ourselves and other individuals in navigating transition? What **insights** might help us navigate such transformation?
        - Perhaps the first key is to accurately diagnose the terrain we're traversing, figure out what’s needed and/or desired before prioritising an appropriate pattern or schema that enables us to overcome our immediate obstacles. Different conceptions are seemingly responsive to different processes.
        - **Let’s sample a selection of potentially useful approaches:******In most modern cultures, the [AN] and [BO] stages are primarily found in toddlers. Learning is through habituation and[ Pavlovian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) conditioning; an associative linear process whereby stimulus provokes a response. The classic example is a dog drooling while its dinner is being prepared, but the same process also applies in large to dementia and substance addiction (e.g. [a junkie searching out a bag of heroin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwlogyj7nFE)).
        - For a loose cannon at the [CP] stage, benevolent autocracy is often warranted. It might sound draconian but given complete freedom inhabitants of this modality will absorb as much space as possible while openly fleecing others of their agency; if you give an inch, they'll take a mile. Graves references[ B.F. Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner),[** **August Aichhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Aichhorn)** **and[** **Kurt Eisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_R._Eissler) as relevant therapies stating __"you put this person in a__[__ ____box__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber)__ psychologically and you don't let him out. You've got to know and accept those rules!". __Most subsistence modalities will have immense difficulties dealing with this conception due to their own ideologies.
        - Working with the [DQ] stage, Graves suggests[ Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) is pretty much the only person who ever had a clue. These subjects need gentle hand-holding and a personal relationship in order to overcome their fears, break down unhelpful positions and foster trust… moving along at a snail's pace thereafter to lead them back into an embodied sense of self. These people need to see the engaging party as an acceptable authority figure or they’ll remain hidden in their shell and won't concede an inch.
        - The [ER]** **modalities gain insight only from what they can procure for themselves, gauging their expectations against outcomes. In this regard,[ encounter groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-groups), wherein people gather to express felt experiences arising out of personal interactions are good places to receive useful feedback. Worth noting however is if the (out) group is unknown to the [ER] centered personality, they'll often observe and leverage the weakness of others members of the group to exploit and instrumentalise them.
        - For those centered in an [FS] modality, Graves held that the[ Rodgerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy) approach was __"a very fine one". __Many of these methods are similar to the [ER] interventions minus the training wheels. Particular methods such as the[ Rodgerean Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument) however, are considered more suitable than others. As the [FS] modality has embarked on a journey of self-exploration they are predominantly asking "why?" questions, so an authentic and congruent 1:1 relationship facilitates deeper inquiry and a shared context.
    - ## Reflections
        - Having familiarised myself – to large degrees – with the various conceptions and underlying processes while writing this, I can say they feel real in relation to my own journey. The ontology is not something I’ll take as gospel but the framework does fit my past with large degrees of accuracy. I can see a cycle of personal conceptions that have repeatedly arisen and broken down again – oscillating with the sea of my life:
        - BO > CP: The modality throughout my teenage years was clearly that of deny-self. Socialised mind did its best to fit in with kin spirits and fill a group niche. This semi-autistic version of me was eventually perturbed into self-awareness via a romantic rejection.
        - CP > DQ: During my university years I moved into an express-self modality. I was exercising ferociously, prolifically writing music and dating regularly. At one point in this cycle a dear friend of mine got fed up with the impulsive behaviour and hit me with “you can’t keep talking over people man”; the guilt of which once again transformed my world view.
        - DQ > ER: My early career seems to accurately fit a deny-self modality where I felt quite disembodied; watching myself in third person while smoking away external tensions as a form of escapism. While working for a particularly imperialistic employer the thought of further subordinating myself to such tyrannical authority really began to grate on me. When the opportunity arose, I quit my job and started a business of my own.
        - ER > FS: As captain of my own ship I moved into an express-self modality; installing sound systems for several high end venues while also beginning to invest in speculative assets. I expanded into night club tech management and eventually burnt myself out on graveyard shifts – moving into a well paid technology job thereafter. My calculated boundary pushing there brought down the wrath of others and eventually led to being made redundant as the startup began to run out of funding.
        - FS > GT: Leaving the world of employment behind to search out like minded peers seems to accurately reflect the “deny-self for acceptance now” conception. I joined a variety of [[Self-Organisation]] initiatives and after some time found refuge in the countryside with a peer. The pace was slow and the location isolating so a sense of dissonance crept in, resultantly I felt moved to affirm myself and have begun to seek stability on my own grounds. This is actually my current situation and at this point I’m still finding a sense of flow while practicing new patterns – I’ve not crossed the river quite yet but I am starting to near the bank.
        - It appears that many sources suggest that the FS > GT transition is the hardest to work through. However, the reasoning for these assertions seem quite thin on the ground and so I’ll share my own experience of this transition. Stated bluntly it feels like I’ve stripped myself of all character leaving a core essence that’s pretty bland, unresponsive and spaced out. However, the upside is an honest sense of self-awareness and I seem to be immersed in a process of systematically rebuilding my “avatar”, “character” or “person” who interacts with the outerworld. There's also a sense of growing self-acceptance (which I thought I’d already found) coming from an open disclosure of my internal world and sharing of secrets.
        - **Disarm lyric video?**
    - ## Criticism
        - While investigating and reflecting on this model, I’ve been taking it with a pinch of salt and reading between the lines. From this perspective it seems pretty solid and I honestly don’t have a huge amount of criticism, however taking a more literal perspective it seems that some of the terminology might benefit from minor adjustments in framing.
        - In particular Graves seems to frame the process from a lens of coping and problem solving which we might say is a form of goal orientation. This seems at odds with his otherwise predominant process orientation; and so perhaps we can view the transitions as a process of healing from damage incurred in prior modalities.
        - Throughout this article I’ve also been cautious not to call the conceptions “levels” – as many transcripts do – because such words can easily lead to a sense of elitism. This is rife in the __Spiral Dynamics __communities which draw upon this work and tends to turn many people off. Graves himself noted in a number of transcripts that “levels'' were uncorrelated with intelligence and that it's more a case of understanding how people do what they do, or how they believe what they believe.
        - While Graves’ research methods were in my opinion generally robust; the [AN] and [BO] conceptions were inferred through extensive study of anthropological literature. This seems fair in the context of his study and a necessary step to avoid the immediacy bias of relying on his own sample – however by looking for conceptions outside his sample and finding them it opens the potential for confirmation bias. Ahh life, the endless double bind!
        - **Other flavours**
        - As previously mentioned, __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ has been expounded on by a number of others. You might describe it as a wellspring form which others like [Ken Wilbur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber) and [Don Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck) drew. Graves used letter pairs, while Wilbur and Beck used (competing) colour schemes and ‘value memes’. Here’s a chart that adds other psychologies to the mix (but also incorrectly attributes colours to Graves... when in actuality it was Don Beck):
        - ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n4KWvD_OgN0SpC10c18zOn4RabXg-5Yle7KFQ4vLi5SqVP_lt5CmhgeSDd5pH8bYLXkXYb7sxU1KQ1bCd2-wVskwQ2TZet0Y-vQUcaz57guYKXUo7H5Y6Ib_8CZ6UBGIlKHcvBF_)
        - As you can see there are a number of people pushing similar material under different lenses and nomenclature but it's notable that Graves probably used the most robust and controlled approach. In [Lovengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loevinger%27s_stages_of_ego_development) case she primarily used sentence completion tests from “exemplar subjects” and [Piaget’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget%27s_theory_of_cognitive_development) work was also largely a case of empirical observations of his own children in uncontrolled environments (but included some clinical interviews with older subjects).
        - Wilbur seems to have conducted no experiments himself; instead collecting a plethora of existing theories and belief systems to map and integrate them into a cohesive and somewhat practical meta-framework - often referred to as “All Quadrants, All Levels”.
        - Let’s take a look at his maps:
        - ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mC5qzyrMfzRP8ewrfhAMEI9DHYhPbyHWl_mGz3sHPnEqf8FBv0JRfkgsLlDfG_yRvTGmeaNPy1d3dD1E4Kza1NqI9jYIThXcNAxWYSWfhltuRv5wyLwb1IfCbGPoVb1UN3JHYGkP)
        - ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fJXO3my0o4Vm9AEG6VqQi6AKZupY6p0EDly6ydyZKKNyF5PkwBKEzzG57OXJwd3GwzecKhw7SDBXlts4UkNtUOhjjCdnO6yqqDSRUxqatEIjoYqWYFCfZrdv3fIXNqMqFH2ScLU7)
        - The simplified chart on the left is perhaps the most relevant, while the exceptionally detailed one on the right is primarily just to provide a sense of perspective - if it evokes curiosity, you can dive deeper on your own. Essentially Wilbur held a view that all perspectives had grains of truth in them but none of them on their own were ultimately right or wrong - they were just different ontological biases; his four quadrants are thus useful as a lens for mapping particular orientations.
        - Invoking Graves and his previously covered research once again for comparison; you might recall that the express-self and deny-self modalities appear to swing like a pendulum? Many perspectives consider such fluctuations as a switching of focus between individual and collective; express-self with an individualistic focus and deny-self as a collective focus. If so, the different modalities also appear to shift gears between interior (subjective) and exterior (objective). For instanstance the [DQ] and [FS] modalities are both deny-self conceptions but the former appears to be more tribal/cultural (WE) and the other more societal (ITS).
        - In all honesty though, reality is a pretty messy and chaotic show - so its unsuprising that we have all these related yet different frameworks to draw on; ontologies for making sense of ontologies! My personal suggestion is therefore to hold them all loosely and consider them a map that’s about as accurate as currently available… **but still just a map.**
    - # Conclusion
        - At this point it seems apparent that __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ has a wide range of implications across a number of fields; particularly in government, business, healthcare, education and social science. With the right eyes and ears it can help enable us to tailor an appropriate response to a given context and meet it in place with right (or deliberately wrong) action!
        - This theory also seems pretty applicable to any number of emerging fields such as cryptocurrency, artificial general intelligence or computer science as they are all artefacts of how we think. These [encoded ideologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ3gmh-d9oI) are the products of our environmental coupling that then become concrete realities and shape the affordances of our daily lives. Having an awareness of what’s shaping us is incredibly important notion to be aware of… and perhaps even more so in the reverse; how we’re using our agency to shape the world and others around us is a deep ethical concern that we can probably all be more aware of; how are we contributing? What kind of subsurface intentions are driving us? How much hubris is really involved in our actions?
        - On related notes this model is proving quite useful as a tool for understanding myself in relation to others; I’m becoming more familiar with my own subconscious value systems with an increased sensitivity to the ontologies of others I’m interacting with. Navigating the tensions present in daily life feels analogous to matching voltage; wherever there's an ontological mismatch there's a energetic bottleneck that restricts flow and leaks potential. Stepping and blending these energetics feels like an artform I could use more practice in yet having an understanding of where people are coming from is certainly helpful in attempting such alchemy!
        - Perhaps beyond these flows is the notion of [situationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International); the conjuring of moments which enable us to grow in safe to fail environments at the collective scale. Performance events or moments that test our capacities and surface our ontologies for what they are; fragile beliefs attachments and conditioned patterning. As Graves initially pondered; can exposure to confusion, contradiction, controversy and conflict help us to become better adapted to our existential environment? I personally think yes but it can be truely exhausting when sustained for too long!
        - None the less my recommendation is:
        - “Buy the ticket, take the ride”
        - Good luck,
        - Josh

    - ## **Conclusion**
        - By now, it's probably apparent that this process of transformation is a pretty expensive endeavor and probably not for everyone. Is your desire for self-transcendence worth it? Are you willing to pay such a price for both personal and collective benefit? Naturally it's a personal call, but if you're not willing to walk through the gates of Hades, it's perhaps best to remain centered where you are - circumstance and aspirations permitting.
        - With that said, if you have a monkey on your back and don’t know why or happen to be interested in tasting the unknown, then learning about this framework may just help you to minimise the cost of the expedition while shining a light on what’s potentially driving yourself and others.
        - If so, during the process of such an immersion; a[ situationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International) approach might be a relevant methodology. By increasing exposure to a [[Stuff/Assorted/Requisite Variety]] of experience; you'll likely be forced to update beliefs and begin to embody the ones that hold true. Just reading about Zen, Stoicism or any other spiritual practice without putting skin in the game is most likely a futile endeavor. They may be useful instructions for self-assembly but utterly irrelevant without expending effort.
        - "Buy the ticket, take the ride".
        - Good luck!

        - Good call, I have been using that one but not particularly referencing anything other than the cycle of involution into dissonance which gives rise to new nerual structures according to Graves. I must have a look through that page, bit first onwards and back into that damn essay I seem to be writing !
    - ## [[Maija]] — 03/12/2021

        - First, some background. Spiral Dynamics was born out of Clare Graves' work; 'Emergent Cyclical Theory' or ECT for short. It's an evolutionary model of human development relevant to individuals, groups and society. Actually it explains a lot more but that's beyond the scope of this article!
            - When? A bit of time/place reference would be useful. I would skip opinionated take on Maslow, there are no good sources on what their relationship was. Most research work I just "skimmed" is appalling as the "specialists" have no knowledge of Maslows latter work.. makes you really question their competency (also on the Spiral Dynamic explanations as Maslow was of a great influence on Grave work). Seems like the level of "feud" was added by the "tabloid press" of our time.
        - " likely that we'll encounter more buddahs about. Or face existential ruin"
            - Very cool! 
            - maybe a bit elaboration or mention that it will be elaborated in later chapter?
        - **Can you sum up phase 1 in key processes (keywords) before discussing then in detail? (view, reaction, relation.. )**

   - Generally this whole part about the research process is informative and very good starting point to read about Grave, but maybe it can be shorter and digested or somehow split into a separate article about Graves process? After all " This article is thus about living the experience! & Actually ECT explains a lot more but that's beyond the scope of this article!"(edited)

        - Ok, so that's a primer on Graves. I've not yet covered his lettering system in depth for good reason. It's essentially the same as spiral dynamics but with each stage divided into two parts; the interior and exterior aspects of evolution. The issue with spiral dynamics is that it simplifies Graves' theory with labels in a very misleading way. This can lead to dogma.
        - [10:29 PM]
        - This could be mentioned before the primer (moved up), as not mentioning what the letters are  lead me  to skip it all together (the level of unknown was beyond curiosity sweetspot).  I get that it is in conflict with "can lead to dogma", but need to work on how to keep curiosity going with all those bags of letters(edited)
        - [10:36 PM]
        - So, I wish to impart that each stage of the spiral is driven by lack of what their 'meme' implies they have obtained: ..
        - Here the curiosity and digestion hits and sweet sweet AHHH satisfaction goes off the charts.
        - [10:41 PM]
        - In EMT levels are referred to by letter pairings rather than colours. The first set [ABCDEDFGH] refer to the life conditions. The second set [NOPQRSTU] refer to emergent coping mechanisims. Let's dig in:

Regardless of which labeling system you prefer, memes, colours or letters; we can see a patterned interaction between interior and exterior domains, and a fluctuation between levels of concern

        - My general conclusion:

I like most of your explanations of Graves theory, it's a great bag of words. And in general you have grown so much in how accessible and readable your paragraphs are. But (maybe because it is WIP) I got quite conflicting ideas about what this article should be as a whole. It had lots of good bits, but to sum up my feel of the "storyline":
It started promising a "living the experience" guide , then went into being Grave primer, then it seemed it will dive into differences between Grave & generalised Spiral dynamics, but took a turn to deep dive into labels (even tho you said "Its deeper than a labels or categories. " and then the conclusion was not the strongest (actually a bit of a "lip service") . 
So many good bits, just how to you keep the flow of expectations? What is the one thing you want the reader to understand?(edited)
        - [11:10 PM]
        - Whatever you do: don't burn your summaries and primer! Maybe a ever evolving open "learning journey" article is a good place to let your __gems of wording complex topics__ live?(edited)

        - Ohhoho, yes - big block of text here! Thanks for all this feedback. I've not read it yet but will do once I recover from being lost in the article for so long. 

Responding to your last bit though. Yes. It's all over the shop at the moment since it's in refactor. I'm still seeing where this will take me haha, so sure as fuck I'm contradicting myself at the moment as I navigate the dilemma of writing this article !

In one respect I think the data and research is super important. So a dry factual approach is the primer, lip service lol. However the process is the thing I personally want to highlight but without the data points it's hard to emphasize the relationships between the levels... I've decided to cross that bridge when I get through the primer though as it's turned into something longer than expected!

Will circle back to your other comments tomorrow, thanks for this huuuge response. You automatically get to be a co-author on ghost now I think... Not sure. You definitely get kudos, props and thanks from me now anyway! Xx

        - np, yeah i tend to go full throttle on analyzes(maybe why i don't get to it as much as i would like to when asked). If you would like to have a go at explaining the level relationships we can do a question / dialogue game tomorrow. 
Sweet dreams xx(edited)
- Holland copy (final?):
    - TL;DR: This article covers a systemic conception of psychology articulated by Clare Graves. The first principals he surfaced are foundational to a number of related theories and integrates many others. If your interested in the field you should probably start here before looking at other work.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JaTeWZLBISLgQdH5ivPYMAZftpwzzZgKPJQP4w2WlIp-o93_Y64Z9ZKMLCw8JihC9JtC3m_ErNSY8HqLCS6tZoFPlGoJcIX9sreFph7LK6bh2RUU1vr-OIwxLeJQT8LrarYzQT1j)
    - ## **Introduction**
        - This article is an exposition highlighting my own investigations into the work of Clare Graves; a New York psychology professor who brought the world an evidence based meta-model known as __Emergent Cyclical Theory. __His work is salient to me because due to its broad utility it’s capable of integrating a plethora of existing theories as well as clarifying a lot of confusion around existential questions.
        - As a species, we are extremely diverse and heterogeneous; resultantly there is a lot of noise and little signal. For many of us, society can seem rife with fragmentation and contradictory views. Gazing through this prism of projections, the black hole of ideology and narrative warfare can feel overwhelming. It’s hard not to get lost in the fractal as such disorder can feel extremely unpredictable, arbitrary and uncertain. This artefact thus originates from a personal desire to discern order from chaos. Are there constants in the complexity of values that drive human behaviour?
        - Graves' work is grounded in inquiry – as opposed to hypothesis – and highlights the importance of an unfolding evolutionary process rather than the static models and prescriptions often found in other psychological literature. Many of these theories do indeed contain grains of truth but let us momentarily pause to note that there are also many castles made out of sand.
        - I’ll endeavour not to mislead you but please note that I’m what you might call an epistemic trespasser in these waters so please engage your critical faculties and do your best to remember that “**the map is not the territory!**”
        - Firstly, I'll prime you with some of the theories history and background. Secondly, I’ll explain the framework and detail some of the research Graves explicated. Thirdly, we’ll discuss the underlying **process** that drives the model with some reflection on its significance and potential use. Finally, I’ll add some of my own experiences and criticism before concluding the essay.
        - Enjoy!
    - ## **An Open Inquiry - Essence**
        - __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ came precariously close to remaining a buried treasure. At one point during the mid 1950's Graves witnessed his friend and colleague Abraham Maslow unceremoniously "torn to pieces" by colleagues at an APA seminar. He subsequently vowed to never put himself into a similar situation until he could adequately defend his own position. Much of his work was later abandoned out of frustration and [the book he was working on](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Ending-Quest-Explores-Treatise/dp/0972474218) remained unpublished until after his death. Only later was it posthumously pieced back together again by peers and archivists digging through his remaining articles, transcripts and seminars.
        - For me, one of the most salient parts of this theory is that it considers the human condition as __**open-ended**__** **with no final state of enlightenment, self-actualization or nirvana. These 'states' may still exist; it’s just that evidence seems to favour an endless search for order in a chaotic universe **without finality**. Even the better known Abraham Maslow embraced this __open-ended__ view despite common interpretations of his work:
        - You should know that Maslow came around to my point of view. If you look at his later writings you will see that he accepted both the cyclic idea that there is more than one kind of expressive system and more than one kind of belonging system, and the system is open ended. We finally, after fighting this over for eight years, came to a fundamental agreement along that line. - Graves ([Lee, 2002,  p. 52](https://www.amazon.com/Levels-Human-Existence-Clare-Graves/dp/097247420X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Levels+of+Human+Existence&qid=1619128459&s=books&sr=1-1))
        - The essence of Graves’ work is that humans develop new bio-psycho-social coping mechanisms to deal with existential problems, and these emergent coping mechanisms arise in response to an[ increasingly complex environment](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile). As the tide of human progress rises[ exponentially](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), it may be that we'll begin to encounter more Buddhas about. Or face existential ruin... [[BreakDownOrBreakThrough]]
        - ⚠️ For those who have done a degree of reading around __Spiral Dynamics, __or __Ken Wilbur etc__,__ __please do your best NOT to draw comparisons just yet. These works are all indeed very similar and also related but I’m deliberately avoiding discussion on these authors because they draw FROM this foundational work and conflating them may lead to confusion ⚠️
    - ## History
        - ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KC1XIlHI1u0LfpFxa45_ngsIBBuWgd9UZFmiMsW2ZNVaclO-fKOoAV6jo56SHlCN92hYzRiqkopR2boYYa3LL2vwrI6fd-tRQQYHU4PWFWQFqvvvRjYmc3f7rHd18PzKkVh_GSmU)
        - In the early 1950's Graves held a position as a psychology professor at Union College NY where a student of his posited the following question: from all the competing psychological theorists, whose model was ultimately correct? With no immediate answer to hand, and a monkey on his back, Graves could only start collecting the data required to find out!
        - **He began with the following lines of inquiry:**
            - Can one provide evidence that conflict and contradiction, confusion and controversy are represented in conceptions of psychological health?
            - What are the conceptions of psychological health existing in the minds of biologically mature human beings?
            - Do the concepts which exist suggest that psychological health should be viewed (a) as a state or condition, or (b) as a **psychological process?**
            - What is the essential nature of psychological health if it is a state or condition?
            - What is the nature of the **process** of psychological health if the basic research indicates that it should be viewed thus?
        - **These drivers were then further expanded into research questions in order to generate relevant data:**
            - How do biologically mature human beings conceive of 'what is the healthy personality'?
            - Do biologically mature humans have, basically, one major identifiable conception of what the psychologically healthy adult is?
            - Do biologically mature humans have more than one conception of what a healthy personality is?
            - If adults have several conceptions of healthy personality, are the conceptions classifiable into groups of similar conceptions?
            - If the various conceptions are classifiable, how can they be classified?(a) by content? (b) structurally? (c) functionally?
            - Will there be evidence that a singular conception of healthy personality stands out as superior to other conceptions?
        - **The primary issue surmised:**
        - __What will be the nature and character of conceptions of psychological health of biologically mature human beings who are intelligent, but relatively unsophisticated in psychological knowledge in general, and in personality theory in particular?__
        - With these formulations, Graves set out to conduct his research which unfolded in approximately four phases: Data Collection, Classification, Observation and Interpretation.
    - ### **Phase 1: Primary Data Collection**
        - At the beginning of Graves investigation he was working in three schools; one all male, another all female and the last was a mixed adult extension division. Over the course of his research he studied a relatively diverse group of about 1,065 subjects aged 18-61.
        - He needed 'representative' subjects for the purposes of his study; which he found in his relatively unsophisticated first year students who were enrolled on his "Theory of Normal Psychology" program. The classroom became his laboratory and he taught in 'novel' ways to accommodate his study. His methodology was applied to eight sets of students, eight different times in order to generate his primary data.
        - Upon starting his lectures, he told his students not to read a single thing on psychology for the first five classes. The time was to be spent discussing what one might put into a conception of healthy personality and a personal conception was to be presented in a paper at the end of the five weeks.
        - In the second five weeks, students were split into random groups and instructed to present their own conception to their peers and receive criticism. Graves observed their reactions and behaviours as their peers "went after them" with critique of their espoused conception. At the end of these additional five weeks, students were to write up a defence or modification of their existing conception. This gave Graves a chance to observe if and how conceptions changed under peer influence.
        - In a third interval of five weeks, the class studied a variety of authorities and again turned in a modification of their original hypotheses. He then sat with randomly selected students to interview them about the process itself; how their conceptions might have changed and the factors that influenced them in changing their minds.
        - **This data set produced:**
            - A large set of beliefs around the conception of a healthy psychology.
            - Reactions to the criticism of espoused beliefs, evidenced in observation and through paper defence and/or modification.
            - Relation to confrontation with authority as evidenced through paper defence or modification.
            - Interview data on the process of the primary experience.
        - **Through this study, a second set of research questions opened up:**
            - What will happen to a person's characterization of mature human behaviour when s/he is confronted with the criticism of his/her point of view by peers who have also developed their own conception of psychologically mature behaviour?
            - What will happen to a person's conception of mature human behaviour when confronted with the task of comparing and contrasting his/her conception of psychologically mature human personality to those conceptions which have been developed by authorities in the field?
            - How will the subjects behave under peer criticism?
    - ### **Phase 2: Classification**
        - ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XbRfS-Ecqc9IBmvjtI_5v-qCvkiJw2DJeougS1SWQzBqEdac9poROVKFiWecFyQxRayHA4HL_gvxkFIWsgcSJ6n10sSevFRtwvnAG-7nF6d8oV24GRcWWUuc_W2Utl8ZTLzQQaw4)
    - ### Discernment and Differentiation
        - Each year an external panel of judges were instructed to classify the data into categories. This process was then blindly repeated with a second panel of judges.
        - **The data points repeatedly collapsed into two primary categories:**
            - Express self; primarily motivated by internal forces.
            - Deny self; predominantly driven by external forces.
        - As these two categories emerged each year (unknown to the panel) the research turned into a process of accumulation. Over 8 years, sub-categories also began to emerge in about 60% of the data. This data was later augmented and interpreted through further research in **phase four **of Graves’ inquiry**.**
        - The primary categories, the labels of which will be expanded on later, and the basic traits of the participants’ conceptions are as follows:
            - Deny self:a) sacrificially - Aka [BO].b) for deferred reward - Aka [DQ].c) for acceptance now - Aka [FS].
            - Express self:a) as self desires in a calculating fashion, at the expense of others - Aka [ER].b) as self desires but not at the expense of others - Aka [GT].
    - ### **Phase 3: Observation of Interactions**
        - This was probably **the most interesting phase** as it would reveal a good deal of information about how different conceptions tend to interact in the social field. **It's also where the situation began to turn into a somewhat more complex puzzle!**
        - With formalised classifications, Graves was now able to study his accumulated data and observations in depth.
            - The first task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to peer criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of espoused conceptions; whether and how peer criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with peers in this process.
            - The second task was to study the formalised conceptions in relation to authoritative criticism as evaluated through a defence/modification of espoused conceptions; whether and how authoritative criticism influenced a subjects conception and the interaction patterns at play with authority in this process.
        - By diving into these interaction patterns, the models of each conception were significantly enriched, aiding the ongoing discernment process outlined in phase 2. Why did it seem that there were such radical differences in the same “primary conceptions”?
        - **To recap; the similarities in the primary conceptions were:**
            - Sacrificial conceptions** **were responsive to external conditions. They saw denial of self and degrees of conformity as the answer to their existential conditions.
            - Expressive conceptions were NOT responsive to external conditions. They saw self expression as a means to overcome their existential conditions but would move into deny-self modalities when "central change" (movement to other modalities) occurred.
        - The subject of importance here was the difference between subjects occupying similar conceptions, particularly for enumerating and enhancing resolution on the subcategories. These findings are summarised below.
        - **Differences between sacrificial conceptions:**Some of deny-self conceptions were dissimilar in relation to their effective change force. Certain subjects (the [DQ] conception) would respond only to an accepted higher authority and NOT their peers, otherwise remaining rigid and defending their initial conceptions to the last. Others however (the [FS] conception) would respond only to peer authority and NOT a perceived higher power. The two classifications were also quite dissimilar in terms of their perceived behavioural freedoms.
        - **Differences between expressive conceptions:**The express-self conceptions were also quite different in terms of effective change forces. A number of subjects (the [ER] conceptions) would change only through self procured sources, while others (the [GT] conceptions) seemed to respond regardless of where thought or information originated from.
        - These conceptions were also dissimilar in terms of perceived behavioural freedoms. Certain subjects (the [ER] conceptions) __"always expressed themselves as if tethers were on them, always tying them down"__, while others (the [GT] conception) didn't feel bound to anything much at all - especially the goals of others. These subjects were generally non-argumentative but would often interject about perceived mistakes.
        - **Group Work:**With increased resolution on the subcategories; students with the same conceptions of psychological maturity were grouped into classes and tasked with a specific problem. These subjects were then left to autonomously form groups and students with a...
        - • [DQ] conception split up into small feudalistic units, each with separate leaders. • [ER] conception had a huge argument – with one eventual leader emerging. • [FS] conception worked well on their own without a leader.• [GT] conception chose the most appropriate leader for the task at hand and later to drop them for someone better suited for the next task.
    - ### **Phase 4: Outliers and Interpretation **
        - The last phase was spent interpreting the data through research and factoring in world views from other non-industrialised cultures. These walks of life were were probably factored in to avoid immediacy bias.
        - Around this time new categories also started to emerge; until this point the available data seemed to point towards a final stage of psychological maturity... but a number of people with the ‘express self but without cost to the others’ conception began to reject their previous views! This contradiction shook Graves’ work at its foundations and for a short time caused him a great deal of confusion.
        - After the occurrence of these anomalies, people from the working classes began to gain access to higher education and it became evident that an earlier sub-category had been missed out; a remorseless 'express self at all costs' modality whom appeared to espouse a 'law of the jungle' mentality. One where 'might is right'.
        - The remorseless [CP] conception was thus the most primordial conception Graves collected himself in his primary sample, though as mentioned prior stages of cognitive evolution were later uncovered through anthropological research.
        - The subjects of this [CP] conception (‘express self at all costs’) however began to shift in their beliefs - lo and behold - into the already documented conception of 'deny self for later reward'! Thus in one stroke the earlier anomaly of [GT] subjects** **denying their own prior conceptions was also resolved; they had undergone a **process **of central change and were starting to embrace a yet inconceived modality. **Subsequently**,** these findings paved the way for psychological health to be viewed as a process rather than fixed state.**
        - This new category [HU] was as far Graves’ primary data went but he and a number of others believed that it wasn't the end of the journey! Given how old this research is already paired with the [rising complexity of our environment](https://necsi.edu/complexity-rising-from-human-beings-to-human-civilization-a-complexity-profile), we may now once again be witnessing the birth of a new conception not listed on the 1974 chart above; the [IV] modality. Graves speculated the progression was a __'six on six ladder' __or octave – so keep an eye out!
    - ## **The Dialectical Ladder**
        - ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dKfo8yzmpitt1WMoiCWPvXLfkgSIMbdY9UTYYvNj1cv5qOsAu5crdIbIGPv_I9Vt7jp7n8m7bq5dK_ObdXtoCP8j5BT12JUrArvhqvHxVhb_sjvj6AS_ssA683nA3Is5KkXxldMY)
        - We’ve intentionally been reviewing just the history of the research and how the conceptions were formed so far. At this point we can begin to cover the topic more generally while trying to elicit some insights. The classifications are probably still a bit unclear so let’s cover those in more depth.
        - The first set of characters in Graves’ notation system [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H] refer to “existential conditions'' or the environment in which we inhabit. While the second set of characters [N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U] refer to what Graves termed “emergent coping mechanisms” – the capabilities we leverage to transcend our environments.
        - These emergent cycles might be thought of as a swinging pendulum where we oscillate between express-self and deny-self modalities in an unfolding process. What I find particularly interesting about the implications of Graves classifications is the generative dialectic between **environment and organism**.
        - **To me, this dialectic feels like the difference between aspiration and embodied action; **the** **environmental context gives rise to a set of needs or desires, which are then slowly manifested through a form of [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) embodied in new and novel behaviours.
        - ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NqXhSVVo01xchssIKVwek95PRKXfqGRTNAMvi1OwASLmSnI1o5hr1kZu-SPhq6vvWrpCYlusH-CzJ_ZBkH-uE2y6jQtWcEaXWfoREjQPsxjADUO-FsS1wdW95jRGGcMM2bD7SV8L)
        - Graves later revised the [GT] and [HU] conceptions to [AN'] and [BO'] as he theorised a __'six on six ladder'. __He did so because__ __these later conceptions closely resembled the earliest stages with a post-subsistance twist.
        - **In contrast** to the Gravesian symbol system of letter pairings; the colours, categories and “value-memes” typically reified in __Spiral Dynamics__ and related materials seem to grossly overlook this generative interplay, reducing it into a static typing system – something that I personally find unhelpful. This focus on static categories is a reductive fallacy that has been used to claim high ground and author legitimacy narratives. In my opinion Graves avoids this pitfall by maintaining a focus on dialectic and process.
    - ### Generative Friction
        - ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/C2ZW1RuGrkpsdTAFiRs2zhLHyoSheVcNQGvSNZZ7qhmdwgVyiy8QfyEiYWyPsnXsqtXCaajQtdYCDv1YHSbI7P4HVl-HD7zLPB3GlZNsWQ9a-cxTxaRNu1Olc8fHq1QVGqXmSF9c)
        - As you might imagine – there can be quite a tension between existential conditions and the formation of 'emergent coping mechanisms'. This friction is perhaps akin to the myth of[ Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) pushing a boulder uphill for all of eternity. Once a local maximum is reached in this seemingly open ended system, the boulder rolls back down again to a new local minimum. Once more we begin work on our next existential challenge!
        - So, having now acquainted ourselves with the various psychological conceptions; and more importantly **the process** of [structural coupling](https://metadesigners.org/Structural-Coupling-Glossary) which occurs between actor and environment, the most interesting questions (for me) become:
            - what actually occurs during this generative **process** of transformation?
            - and how do such bio-psycho-social phase shifts happen?
        - Lets zoom in on the transformative process:
            - **Potential**The necessary “higher order structures” must be present within the organism – which Graves saw as neurological systems within the brain. Unfortunately, further resolution on this matter has eluded me during the course of my investigations. [Dąbrowski's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration#Development_potential) work on positive disintegration may be relevant however; he points to the factors of over-excitability, personal capabilities and drive for autonomy as significant factors in the development of an “independent personality”. At the organisational level, we might speculate that these structures could be represented by the variety of people, rituals, values, coordination protocols, practices and [memetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics) available within a group.
            - **Resolution of existential problems**Stages of expanding (and contracting) awareness cannot be skipped or bypassed. Problems faced at earlier stages of existence must be resolved in order to release psychic energy for advance. First things first!
            - **Feelings of dissonance**A breakdown of solutions to one’s immediate existential problems MUST be faced along with a period of crisis and regression. The dissonance of this situation is required to catalyse biochemical changes that drive a regressive search for old patterns of behaviour in order to establish a previous apparent solution to the situation. Such a search is certain to end in arrestment, regression or growth as old solutions to previous problems DO NOT apply to the new context any better than the way of life whose inadequacy triggered the search initially. This might be considered a form of psychological [bifurcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory).
            - **Gaining of insights**Putting an end to the regressive search, unlocking the formation of new structures and propelling an evolution to the next modality, is **insight**. This insight MUST enable the organism to find an equilibrium in the immediate environment.
            - **Removal of barriers**When this insight is reached, few in the environment will share the same understanding and thus the barriers of friends, family, processes etc. must be overcome or ignored to make such a leap.
            - **Opportunity to consolidate**The last necessary condition for the emergence of new structures is a consolidation factor which comes into play as the organism begins to practice and affirm the new behaviour. Here the implementation of insights are being achieved and accomplished.
    - ### **Engaging with transformation**
        - Having hopefully grokked the various conceptions and **the deeper process **of transformation; how do we leverage this understanding? Can it be used to help us judge appropriate actions in a given context to empower both ourselves and other individuals while navigating transition? What **insights** might help us help us to flourish?
        - Perhaps the first key is to accurately diagnose the terrain we're traversing, figure out what’s needed and/or desired before prioritising an appropriate pattern or schema that enables us to overcome our immediate obstacles. Different conceptions are seemingly responsive to different processes.
        - **Let’s sample a selection of potentially useful approaches:**In most modern cultures, the [AN] and [BO] stages are primarily found in toddlers. Learning is through habituation and[ Pavlovian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) conditioning; an associative linear process whereby stimulus provokes a response. The classic example is a dog drooling while its dinner is being prepared, but the same process also applies in large to dementia and substance addiction (e.g. [a junkie searching out a bag of heroin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwlogyj7nFE)).
        - For a loose cannon at the [CP] stage; benevolent autocracy is often warranted. It might sound draconian but given complete freedom inhabitants of this modality will absorb as much space as possible while openly fleecing others of their agency; if you give an inch, they'll take a mile. Graves references[ B.F. Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner),[** **August Aichhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Aichhorn)** **and[** **Kurt Eisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_R._Eissler) as relevant therapies stating __"you put this person in a__[__ box__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber)__ psychologically and you don't let him out. You've got to know and accept those rules!". __Most subsistence modalities will have immense difficulties dealing with this conception due to the limitations of their own ontology.
        - Working with the [DQ] stage, Graves suggests[ Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) is pretty much the only person who ever had a clue. These subjects need gentle hand-holding and a personal relationship in order to overcome their fears, break down unhelpful positions and foster trust… thereafter moving along at a snail's pace to lead them back into a sense of embodied self. These people need to see the engaging party as an acceptable authority figure or they’ll remain hidden in their shell without conceding an inch.
        - The [ER]** **modalities gain insight only from what they can procure for themselves, gauging their expectations against outcomes. In this regard,[ encounter groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-groups), wherein people gather to express felt experiences arising out of personal interactions are good places to receive useful feedback. Worth noting however is if the (out) group is unknown to the [ER] centred personality, they'll often observe and leverage the weakness of others members of the group to exploit and instrumentalise them.
        - For those centred in an [FS] modality, Graves held that the[ Rodgerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy) approach was __"a very fine one". __Many of these methods are similar to the [ER] interventions minus the training wheels. Particular methods such as the[ Rodgerean Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogerian_argument) however, are considered more suitable than others. As the [FS] modality has embarked on a journey of self-exploration they are predominantly asking "why?" questions, so an authentic and congruent 1:1 relationship facilitates deeper inquiry and a shared context.
        - We'll stop here as [GT] and [HU] conceptions are open on all channels, learning from every encounter and situation. Discussion on these modalities will also be relatively speculative.
    - ## Reflections
        - As I've been writing this document, I can say that the conceptions feel quite real in relation to my own journey. A schema is not something I’ll ever take for gospel but the framework does fit my past with large degrees of accuracy. I can see a cycle of personal conceptions that have repeatedly arisen and broken down again while oscillating upon the carrier wave of my life:
        - BO > CP: The modality throughout my teenage years was clearly that of deny-self. Socialised mind did its best to fit in with kin spirits and fill a group niche. This semi-autistic version of myself was eventually perturbed into a sense of self-awareness via a romantic rejection.
        - CP > DQ: During my university years I moved into an express-self modality. I was ferociously exercising, prolifically writing music and dating regularly. At one point in this cycle a dear friend of mine got fed up with the impulsive behaviour and hit me with the statement “you can’t just keep talking over people man”; the guilt of which once again transformed my world view.
        - DQ > ER: My early career seems to accurately fit a deny-self modality where I felt quite disembodied; watching myself in third person while smoking away external tensions as a form of escapism. While working for a particularly imperialistic employer the thought of further subordinating myself to such tyrannical authority began to grate on me. When the opportunity arose, I quit my job and started a company of my own.
        - ER > FS: As captain of my own ship I moved into an express-self modality; installing sound systems for several high end venues while also beginning to invest in speculative assets. I expanded into night club tech management and eventually burnt myself out on graveyard shifts – moving into a well paid technology job shortly thereafter. My calculated boundary pushing there provoked push back and brought down the wrath of others, eventually leading to being made redundant as the startup began to run out of funding.
        - FS > GT: Leaving the world of employment behind to search out like minded peers seems to accurately reflect the “deny-self for acceptance now” conception. I joined a variety of [[Self-Organisation]] initiatives and after some time found refuge in the countryside with a peer. The pace was slow and the location isolating so a sense of dissonance crept in, resultantly I felt moved to affirm myself and have begun to seek stability on my own grounds. This is actually my current situation and at this point I’m still finding a sense of flow while practising new patterns – I’ve not crossed the river quite yet but I am starting to near the bank.
        - It appears that many sources suggest that the FS > GT transition is the hardest to work through. However, the reasoning for these assertions seem quite thin on the ground and so I feel compelled to share my own experience of this transition. Stated bluntly it feels like I’ve stripped myself of all character leaving a bland core essence thats been pretty unresponsive and spaced out. The upside hawever is an honest sense of self-awareness. I also seem to be embedded in a process of rebuilding my “avatar” in a systematic way from the ground up unintentionally taking on the properties of each stage that seems to change every two months or so. There's also a growing sense of self-acceptance (which I thought I’d already found) coming from an open disclosure of my internal world.
    - ### Criticism
        - While exploring and reflecting on this model, I’ve been taking it with a pinch of salt and reading between the lines. From this perspective it feels pretty solid and I honestly don’t have a huge amount of criticism. Taking a more literal perspective however it seems that some of the terminology might benefit from minor adjustments in framing.
        - In particular Graves seems to frame the process from a lens of coping and problem solving which we might say is a form of goal orientation. This seems at odds with his otherwise predominant process orientation; and so perhaps we can view the transitions as a process of healing from damage incurred in prior modalities.
        - Throughout this article I’ve also been cautious not to call the conceptions “levels” – as many transcripts do – because such words can easily lead to a sense of elitism. This is rife in the __Spiral Dynamics __communities which draw upon this work and tends to turn many people off. Graves himself noted in a number of transcripts that “levels'' were uncorrelated with intelligence and that it's more a case of understanding how people do what they do, or how they believe what they believe.
        - While it seems that the research methods were generally robust; the [AN] and [BO] conceptions were inferred through extensive study of anthropological literature as previously mentioned. This seems fair in the context of his study and a necessary step to avoid the immediacy bias of solely relying on his own sample; however by looking for conceptions outside his sample and finding them it opens the potential for confirmation bias. Ahh, the thin line and endless double bind!
    - # Conclusion
        - It seems apparent to me at this point that __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ has a wide range of implications across a number of fields; particularly in government, business, healthcare, education and social science.__ __We might thereby consider it an aid for anticipating potential futures, or as a lens for [systemic intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_intervention); with the right eyes and ears it can help enable us to tailor an appropriate response to a given context and meet it in place with right (or deliberately wrong) action!
        - Further to that, __Emergent Cyclical Theory__ seems pretty applicable to the emerging fields such as cryptocurrency, artificial general intelligence and computer science as they are all artefacts of how we think. These [encoded ideologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ3gmh-d9oI) are the products of our environmental coupling which then become concrete realities and shape the affordances of our daily lives. Having an awareness of what’s shaping us and the modality that created it is an incredibly important notion to be aware of… and perhaps even more so in the reverse; how we’re using our agency to shape the world and others around us is a deep ethical concern that we can probably all be more aware of. How are we contributing? What values are driving our actions and behaviour? How much hubris is involved?
        - Navigating the tensions present in daily life feels analogous to matching voltage; wherever there's an ontological mismatch there's a energetic bottleneck that restricts flow and leaks potential. Stepping and blending these energetics is an art form I could personally use more practice in, yet having an sense of where others are coming from is certainly helpful in attempting such alchemy!
        - Perhaps beyond this is a notion of [situationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International); the conjuring of moments which enable us to grow in safe to fail environments at the collective scale. Performance events and circumstances which test our capacities and surface our ontologies for what they are; fragile beliefs, attachments and conditioned patterns. As Graves initially pondered; can exposure to confusion, contradiction, controversy and conflict help us to become better adapted to our existential environment? I personally think so, but buyer beware, it can be exhausting when sustained over long periods of time!
        - None the less my recommendation is:
        - “Buy the ticket, take the ride”
        - Good luck,
        - Josh
