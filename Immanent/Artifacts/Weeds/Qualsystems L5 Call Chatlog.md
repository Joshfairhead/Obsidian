# Qaulsystems L5 Chatlog

20:04:02 From Tim to Everyone : Iâ€™m a bit poorly too; sorry if Iâ€™m only half present
20:04:36 From Ian Wight to Everyone : I know the feeling Timâ€¦
20:04:39 From Ben Young to Everyone : Sorry to hear that Tim! Hopeit is not too bad.
20:06:37 From Tim to Everyone : Just cold and fever; thanks
20:11:50 From John Hicks to Everyone : Qualsystems as a way of noticing
20:12:35 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Very much like carrot cards for directing our attention John - just feels more disciplined
20:13:18 From John Hicks to Everyone : tarot ?
20:13:24 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Haha yeah
20:13:30 From John Hicks to Everyone : or carrot â€¦ that could be good for seeing in the dark
20:13:34 From John Hicks to Everyone : following the legends
20:15:28 From Ian Wight to Everyone : Understanding as all-round self-relating - not just â€˜underâ€™ but also â€˜overâ€™, and â€˜innerâ€™ and â€˜outerâ€™ - with an emphasis on the standing, rather than one orientation.
20:16:19 From John Hicks to Everyone : relationships as primary
20:16:47 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Frequency > resonant modes > objects
20:18:03 From John Hicks to Everyone : Â«Â +1Â Â» !
20:18:24 From Bruce Allen Hecht to Everyone : order of time: https://physicsworld.com/a/carlo-rovelli-the-author-of-the-order-of-time-discusses-perhaps-the-greatest-mystery/
20:18:46 From Ian Wight to Everyone : What medium are we working in? Beyond the everyday thinking mind - into heart, soul and spirit realms. Into the sphere of discernment, or divination for some. So - pretty deep/wide/high â€˜sourceâ€™ territoryâ€™â€¦ ?
20:18:50 From John Hicks to Everyone : Rivelli : quantum relationship
20:18:52 From Bruce Allen Hecht to Everyone : new book: Helgoland: https://www.npr.org/2021/05/27/1000444659/helgoland-offers-a-new-way-to-understand-the-world-and-our-place-in-it
20:20:10 From John Cusano (CT, US) to Everyone : Thanks, Bruce -
20:20:30 From Ian Wight to Everyone : Relationships takes us into different â€˜poiesisâ€™ territory - not auto, not social, but co-poiesis?
20:20:54 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Omni perhaps Ian
20:41:57 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : How close are Aristotles 4 causes to the tetrad?
20:46:45 From Ben Young to Everyone : I seem to remember JG Bennett says something about this somewhere which I could try to find
20:48:02 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Oh yeah? that would be great though I can dig into a dramatic universe myself if its there
20:48:08 From John Hicks to Everyone : yes in DU I i believe
21:14:45 From Ben Young to Everyone : Although 'in the DU' does not narrow things down very much...
21:14:56 From Andrew Curry, London to Everyone : @Sotirios â€” generationalâ€”Elise Boulding has a notion of the â€œ200 year presentâ€ â€” 100 years backwards and 100 years forward.
21:18:33 From Sotirios (Vancouver) to Everyone : Thx Andrew.  Thx group, I am revved up now.
21:19:59 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : I also noticed a bunch of additional nodes in the octad
21:21:36 From John Hicks to Everyone : Abbotty â€¦.
21:23:20 From Ben Young to Everyone : josh - do you mean the inner intersections of the lines in the octad diagram? I was wondering about them. If the octad was drawn in 7 dimensional space then there would not be any intersections so I'm confused whether there should be inner intersections.
21:24:44 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Yes Ben that was what I was asking
21:25:11 From Ben Young to Everyone : shall we Ask Tony -- ?
21:25:24 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Defo!
21:26:03 From John Hicks to Everyone : Fascinatingâ€¦ since 7 dimensional space is a bit the JGB finality
21:26:12 From John Hicks to Everyone : 3 time, 3 space and 1 harmony
21:26:34 From John Hicks to Everyone : would make sense that the octad represents Â«Â completionÂ Â» in that sense
21:31:34 From Ben Young to Everyone : Mmm... but if the nodes of the qualsystems are tied to actual dimensions that would mean (maybe) that tetrads or below are limited to space (i.e. 3 dimensions) and that doesn't seem right to me
21:32:43 From John Hicks to Everyone : yes â€¦ but worth asking about
21:33:01 From John Hicks to Everyone : independent and mutually relevant â€¦ could be dimensional in that way
21:33:20 From John Hicks to Everyone : and tetrad is the first Â«Â substantialÂ Â» thing in the DU
21:33:33 From John Hicks to Everyone : i.e. the first that has material existence (?)
21:35:18 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : Post-diciplinarity FTW :P
21:36:00 From John Cusano (CT, US) to Everyone : Buckminster Fuller referred to himself as a comprehensivist
21:36:07 From Josh Fairhead - Geneva this time to Everyone : hahaha
21:36:53 From John Hicks to Everyone : But with qualsystems, one might say that knowing about one subject really well IS transdisciplinary, since the same structures are present elsewhere
21:36:57 From Ben Young to Everyone : This is head-melting, but I think if we are going to link the nodes of qualsystems to Bennett's (or anyone's) dimensions then you' dhave be allowed to pick whatever dimensions you wanted to put them together. So you could have a dyad that had one node in extension and another node in hyparxis. I'm pretty sure my brain can't handle thinking about this.
21:37:03 From Ian Wight to Everyone : Beyond transdisciplinary? In a post-discipline privileging context?
21:38:20 From Andrew Curry, London to Everyone : An accessible paper or explanation of boundary critique would be welcome!
21:44:09 From Ben Young to Everyone : Jim -- can you see this message? I was interested in your topic in our breakout group and would be glad to pursue it with you 'off line' or on Slack if you want
21:53:08 From Ian Wight to Everyone : What might we have in common? A curiosity about (becoming) three-horizoners, three-horizoning?
21:54:30 From Ian Wight to Everyone : Seeking to become more exquisite makers of exquisite makings?
21:59:01 From Ian Wight to Everyone : understanding, or all-round-standing?
21:59:41 From Ian Wight to Everyone : common-meaning-making as co-poiesis
21:59:46 From John Hicks to Everyone : Meaning â€¦ .is the meaning of life ?
22:00:31 From Ian Wight to Everyone : life-affirming
22:01:27 From Bruce Allen Hecht to Everyone : thanks! I look forward to follow up next week, be well
22:01:49 From Andrew Curry, London to Everyone : Thanks for the session. I need to leave, howeverâ€¦
