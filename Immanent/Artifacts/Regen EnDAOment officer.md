    - Summary
        - At Pillar we were building a vertically integrated crypto wallet. The organisation structure was managed emergence (start up on steroids). I was the first volunteer post ICO and hired to work as part of the core team as the organisation scaled from 7-60 in the first year. My role was transdisciplinary in nature but in more concrete terms I worked across the fields of marketing, communications, ecosystem development, R&D, product and design.
- #### Assignment
	- #### What do you think would be the outcomes a successful enDAOment program? Why?
		- Network security. Without this, the integrity of the initiative can be compromised.
		- Maximally viable decentralisation. In order to foster equality of opportunity while maintaining a level playing field, asymmetries should be minimised and spread out. This aids network scalability as it keeps the possibility space open for a heterogeneous and diverse ecology of network actors to form (e.g. Farmers, Scientists, Engineers).
		- Full stakeholder engagement. As communities arise out of communication, engagement can be considered an indication of network health - especially during growth phases. It can also be considered indicative of a network serving its stakeholders needs.
		- Reinvestment and support for further network growth. Ecology is full of circularity and self-replication; reinvestment from participants would be indicative of a project maturing towards stability. Additional sponsorships would also signify external validation of a maturing ecosystem. 
	
	- #### What process and criteria would you use to select and evaluate candidates for enDAOment?
		- The first selection criteria would be that candidates are legal organisations with a stated purpose of ecological regeneration. The second selection criteria would be a cost, risk, benefit analysis of the candidate. The third selection criteria would be that there is sufficient variety in the consortium to effectively integrate the candidate and sufficient wholeness in the candidate to integrate with the consortium. 
		- Evaluation methodologies should ideally take an integrated approach based on numerous frameworks, indicators and metrics. Utilisation of a singular methodology will create an unintentional selection bias; reducing variety and thus ecosystem resilience. Candidates should be able to provide information about the frameworks and approaches they are using in order to gauge their potential against recognised standards or the viability of creating new ones (e.g. CarbonPlus). 
		- A candidate organisation should also embody a number of first principals encompassing but not limited to; reciprocity, integrity, uniqueness/variety, appreciative inquiry/innovation, potential, embeddedness, systemic impact/leverage and fit (correspondence) with the networks long and short term goals.
	
	- #### Please create and upload a one-pager, pitch, document, image or video to reach out to potential community staking DAO candidates. This should help them understand the process, the vision as well as assess their alignment. Feel free to do this in the format of your choice.

	- #### Describe your thinking and goals to create the outreach artifact above.
		- My first thought while creating this artefact was about the audience. Assuming I will actually reach out to my network with this if successful in this process, I decided to create something suitable for those who may be exposed to this outreach. 

		- My primary audience is thus the likes of the Capra Course Alumini Network, H3 University and Odyssey.org ecosystem partners (e.g. The Sovereign Nature Foundation). The artefact doesn't assume prior knowledge of the following themes but unifying threads amongst such organisations are nature, complexity and technology. 

		- The title of the artefact was formed as appeal to the world view of these organisations; one which often values ecology over technology. This is followed by appealing metaphorical imagery and a warm introduction to the Regen foundation signalling legitimacy and providing context to prime our proposition.

		- The body then explains what we are doing and appeals to both audience ethos and their expectancies - ideology and rewards. Enough detail is provided for potential candidates to filter themselves adequately, with further contact openly invited in the case of uncertainty.

	- #### Which communities and organizations in your network would you reach out to using this artifact? How would you go about the process of outreach?

		- Capra Alumni Network - I'd firstly get in contact with Mira the course administrator and request help from her to distribute it to the network. She's often helpful and may be willing to extend our reach via newsletter or by weaving the orgs together in some way. Secondly I'd post on the Alumni forums. Thirdly, I'd reach out to Brenda from the SystemsLab (personal connection) who's in direct contact with Fritjof working with private and institutional parties that may be interestingly connected.

		- H3Uni - I've a personal relationship with Anthony Hodgson, H3's founder, so I'd request his help propagating information to appropriate parties. I'd also talk to other administrative parties there that are well connected. Having done some connecting for them, I assume they will act reciprocally. 

		- Odyssey.org - I'm well known in the Odyssey ecosystem from previous antics with the Commons Stack. Rutger the CEO would probably quite like to form a relationship with the Regen Foundation, while the organisation would likely facilitate outreach for us as connecting ecosystems is at the base of Odysseys operations. 

		- Sovereign Nature Initiative - A very close friend who consults as their lawyer set up the foundation. He'd probably be very happy to make introductions as well as facilitate outreach through their networks. 

		- OpenCo-op - Personal links with the two Olis stewarding this Loomio group. Connected with many commons oriented communities such as [[Enspiral]] or the P2P foundation.

		- Other communities that may add variety; [[Bonfire.link]], 0xSalon, Giveth/Commons Stack, LiminalVillage.com, [[RatPark.Org]] and other associates.

	- #### Walk through your approach to assess and evaluate this community's eligiblity to receive an enDAOment of REGEN tokens
		- The first matter would be to figure out if they have a legal organisation that they can act through. Assuming so, I'd wish to know more about their organisational structure - how their organisational governance works and if they have records of their activity. I'd then wish to hear about their preservation efforts and how they care for their local biodiversity. If they use any frameworks or accounting methodologies I'd like to know how they monitor the outcomes and effects of their methods and the types of indicators they use to verify their outcomes. 

		- This should inform us of their needs to large degrees, and indicate to us the depth of support needed. Given we have appropriate resources to meet these needs, a decision on their candidacy can be made.

	- #### Assuming that this community is selected for enDAOment, describe the process you would use to onboard them and engage them successfully in the governance of the Regen token network ecosystem?
		- An assessment of the communities technological capacity would need to be made. 

		- Assuming the community is unfamiliar with blockchain a number of compromises may need to be accepted. If necessary the Regen Foundation will maintain custody of keys and distribute votes as delegated by the community. How the community weights its votes is dependent on their internal governance process; if help is needed to formalise this for the sake of voting then support will be offered and methodologies implemented through a dialectical process. 

	- #### The Regen Network is currently based on Cosmos SDK. How would you onboard the community members to successfully participate in governance in this system? What tools and processes do you envision being useful for this (if any)?
		- Consortium participants need to be able to stake their tokens in order to participate in governance. There are a number of wallets in the Cosmos ecosystem that can stake ATOM and assuming REGEN is of a similar standard, participants can probably sign transactions and stake with a tool like Trust Wallet. This is likely one of the easiest options at present as as its a cross-platform, cross-chain, mobile wallet. Instructions and guides outlining the steps to participate can be written up for the most popular interfaces.

		- Most rural communities however, will not be so crypto-literate. This means that signing a transaction and staking tokens may be difficult for them without a dedicated interface. Ideally communities will be provided one of these in order to simplify things; either via a dedicated app or through integrations with wallet providers. 

		- If the community cannot work with these technologies, the foundation will assume a fiduciary duty to do so on their behalf for a given time; this would not be an ideal outcome, but perhaps necessary at times. 

	- #### Describe a community that in your perspective embodies good governance practices. Why did you pick this community?
		- For me [[Enspiral]] is the current poster child for non-hierarchical, decentralised governance existing in the wild. It's governed by its participants and has led to a number of successful spin off projects that are now influencing the world. According to its initial founders, this has in large part been due to a hosting culture which has enabled the network to act as a container for wide range of actors and projects without imploding. Relationships, power and trust are also regular topics of discussion; this raises the awareness of new participants so they may see what dynamics are alive within the network and navigate them if necessary. 

		- The ZeroMQ community have also done a great job at governing open-source code bases. There are a number of processes that have been established over the years, distilled into design patterns and made explicit here: https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/social-architecture/content/chapter1.html

	- #### How would you design the governance of the REGEN token network to account for climate justice and inclusion? How would you ensure buy-in from all stakeholders for the governance decisions?
		- For me, designing governance and setting up social architectures is a question that's been at the heart of philosophical debate for millennia. Its a polarity of agency vs determinism, and in my opinion it's a field that's probably best navigated by configuring initial conditions and stewarding emergence as a generative process.

		- More concretely, if the network governance is to account for climate justice and inclusion then it should embody the principals in its design - which means using them to set it up. To this end they will be considered as guiding qualities when assessing candidates for endowment. Having a diverse group that embodies these principals will be necessary to their successful implementation, especially if consent based governance practices are used (they tend to hold more space for peoples values because NO is considered normal).
