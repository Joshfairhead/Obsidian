- **General guidelines/how it works**
    - [Community Space/Call outline](https://fundingbox.com/spaces/ledger-ledger-news-and-updates/5dbfcb7d52317832f85906c8)
    - **LEDGER** is looking for SMEs, teams, organisations and researchers that want to shift data management, leveraging on decentralised algorithms based on blockchains, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and/or peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies to address Privacy-by-Design, reliability, trustworthiness and openness to build human centric solutions.
    - **Summary/outline of process**
        - Proposals should address specific social or industrial challenges related to one or more of the application domains or challenges, defined within the Strategic Research and Innovation Work Programme.
        - Proposals should explicitly address a research component related to the topic of Decentralized Data Governance, Resulting MVPs and services should be able to provide a significant improvement in terms of data sovereignty for end users, and
        - The results of the bottom-up projects should be compliant with Free and [[[[Open Source]]]] Licences (i.e. [[Open Source]] Hardware, Free and [[Open Source]] Software).
        - LEDGER will only support bottom-up projects that will commit to generate Open Knowledge as result of their projects in the shape of free and [[Open Source]] software, and [[Open Source]] hardware” and “Open Access” accordingly with the nature of the result, being software, hardware of other intangible piece of knowledge (i.e. research paper).
        - Though teams could submit multiple applications, neither team member nor any legal entity can be funded twice by LEDGER. In the case more than one proposal with any similar team members or from the same organisation will be among the 16 selected projects only the one with more points will be funded.
        - Only proposals submitted through the Open Call submission tool at https://ledger-2nd-opencall.fundingbox.com/ and within the Call duration will be accepted. Proposals submitted by any other means, will not be evaluated.
        - Only the documentation included in the application form and in the attachments to the form will be considered by Evaluators. The attachments can be in the following formats: PDF, PNG, JPG, AVI, mp4.
        - Please note - the information from the attachments will not be scored by evaluators (this is additional information to support the proposal). The information provided should be actual, true and complete and should allow the assessment of the proposal.

        - 3 = Good: proposal addresses the criterion well, but a number of shortcomings are present.
        - 4 = Very good: proposal addresses the criterion very well, but a small number of shortcomings are
present.
        - 5 = Excellent: proposal successfully addresses all relevant aspects of the criterion. Anyshortcomings are minor
			- ![](assets/NGICriterea.png)
    - **Excellence**
        - **Ambition**: The applicants are invited to demonstrate to what extent the proposed experiment is beyond the State of the Art related with the application of privacy by design and decentralized data governance in the operational environment targeted by the experiment and describe the
innovative approach behind it __(e.g. ground-breaking objectives, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models__). The applicants need to also demonstrate to what extent the proposed experiment leverages on a research component related
with the topic of Decentralised Data Governance.
        - **Innovation:** applicants have to provide information about the level of innovation within the vertical selected and about the degree of differentiation that this experiment will bring. This should include he definition of concrete performance targets in one or several of the domains described in this
Open Call. Moreover, the proposal should state how these performance targets will be achieved.
        - **Soundness of the approach:** Applicants have to contribute premises of the proposed ideas.
        - **Cross-value chain approach:** The applicants have to provide concrete and verifiable arguments, and/or evidences, regarding to what extent the proposed project will rely upon, or will contribute to, the collaboration and integration of different innovation actors (for instance, by including large
enterprises, SMEs, public authorities, and research organizations)
    - **Impact**
        - **Market opportunity:** The applicants are invited to demonstrate a clear idea of what they want to do and whether the new/improved product has market potential, e.g. because it solves a problem for a specific target customer base.
        - **Reusability potential and contribution to grow Free and [[Open Source]] hardware and software ecosystems:** The applicants have to provide information about how the experiment might contribute to provide new building blocks (applications, algorithms, among others) that might help to grow Free and [[Open Source]] hardware and software ecosystems. 
        - **IPR Management3:**The applicants need to demonstrate how they will comply with the openness principle by addressing free and [[Open Source]] Hardware and Software.
    - **Implementation**
        - **Team:** The applicants have to provide details about their management and leadership qualities; their ability to take a concept from ideas to market; their capacity to carry through their ideas and understand the dynamics of the market they are trying to tap into. The team should be balanced, cross-functional, and fully dedicated to the project and with a strong background and skill base. __The applicants must demonstrate how they will comply with the multidisciplinary principle of addressing at least 1 Researcher, 1 Developer and 1 entrepreneur.__ Teams with more than 1 developer will be positively validated as to build an MVP in 9 months will require a strong dedication.
        - **Resources:** Demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of the resources assigned to get the objectives/deliverables proposed. One important aspect is that applicants’ state clearly in the proposal that what they propose can be developed using LEDGER partners’ capabilities.
        - **Gender balance:** Gender balance and teams with higher percentage of female team members will obtain more points in the -pre-scoring phase.
    - **Bonus points**
        - LEDGER Open Calls will also reward especially those teams that present high impact solutions __satisfying values such as privacy-by-design; the capacity to influence the norms and standards regulating technological, algorithmic and data sovereignty; business models that provide revenue for all participants, for instance in the form of decentralised dividend allocations and forms of business structures like platform cooperatives that leverage steward-ownership models for the Internet Commons.__
            - Privacy by design, technological normas and standards = Holochain world [[Thomas]]
            - Business models = [[Team of Teams]] and [[Open coop/murmurings.]] / [[Mapping Project]] [[Roberto]] [[Oli]]
- **Review process**
    - An exhaustive “Review Process” will be implemented in order to do a proper follow up of the selected bottom-up projects: there will be several “Review milestone” and the financial support will be provided after some of these milestones, always linked to the achievement of the KPIs/Deliverables established. The “Review Milestones” will be applied in 2 steps as illustrated in the following figure: __(click arrow to unfold diagram)__
		- ![](assets/NGIReview.png)
    - In a first step of the review process, the Technical/Business performance will be evaluated based on the KPIs and Deliverables established at the beginning of each Stage by the “Mentoring Committee”. Bottomup projects not reaching the minimum KPIs or whose Deliverables are not validated by the “Mentoring Committee” yet, because they are not mature enough, will not be candidates to upgrade to the next stage. These projects will not get the payment associated to the milestone until their mentors and LEDGER project managers consider the milestone achieved. They will be able to continue with the programme and next milestones until the end of the first stage of the venture builder programme (month 9).
    - In the second step, the “Selection Committee’’, will ratify a final decision, based on the info provided by the “Mentoring Committee”. The teams will receive a detailed feedback and advice to further develop their activities from LEDGER Mentors.

            - Description(s)
                - In an ideal digital society, everything starts with owning your digital identity and data. This doesn't exist in isolation, it exists as part of a deeply interconnected network; a **living** web of trust. We are building the infrastructure to construct and navigate these social relations in digital ecosystems. 
                - This social graph is built on top of Holochain, leveraging its data integrity layer and fundamentals of privacy by design and agent-centricity. Even when connecting with others, users maintain ownership and control over their identity and data.
                - Anyone can then create apps which allow the user to leverage this web of trust in novel ways, for example; self curating phone books, interactive events, reputational currencies and new forms of organisation. 
                - This will also be our business model; build [[Open Source]] white label code, then sell curated experiences through customised applications or consulting to other entities or institutions.

    - [x] **Excellence**
        - [x] **Challenge and Product / Service **
            - Description - **address open innovation**
                - Explain the problem you're addressing and how your product will overcome it. Also, describe your product/service, and the differential advantages and enhanced value it offers. Highlight the innovative approach behind it (e.g. ground -breaking objectives, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models) (max. 1000 characters)
            - Response
                - A)
                    - Our tools shape our behaviours. We then accidentally created control oriented paradigms (permissions) resulting in pathological asymmetric tooling like Cambridge Analytica. We are reversing the trend with mutually sovereign, **living social graphs** on a Web Of Trust infrastructure (Holochain).
                    - The organisational model is novel because it's peer to peer and self organising network; its a non-prescriptive community/ecosystem thats been running since April called [[Hack-Along]]. The team applying to this grant are a self-assembled crew from this larger congregation who wish to build local first tooling. These tools can later be white-labeled for other self organising networks/events like [[Enspiral]] or Odyssey should they wish to contribute towards development costs. 
                    - The technology paradigms we are using enable user owned data in a standardised interoperable format - meaning no more vendor lock in!
                - B)
                    - We are addressing vendor lock-in with mutually sovereign social graphs! Because users own and control their identity and data they can also port it, and because the data in question is their social graph it means that other applications will be able to rapidly prototype new capabilities and experiences without having to reach network effects at their own user base.
                    - The product is a social graph built on a web of trust, so the services we will sell will be customisations and consulting. For instance, a client might want a [[Supply Chain]] app where employees attest to the receipt of goods -  this could easily leverage our infrastructure with the customisation of an added attestation capability.
                    - Our organisational model is novel because we observe Conways law and work as a collective intelligence; a community/platform cooperative called Hackalong.io. Hence we are building a bottom up infrastructure to enable this network as well as other ecosystems and pilot projects.

            - Description
                - Describe the research component related with the topic of Distributed Data Governance or Privacy by Design in which your product/service is leveraging on (max. 500 characters)
            - Response
                - A)
                    - Our service leverages research on digital identity and the Web-of-Trust; its roots extend back to Xerox Parc in the 70s and has continued in multiple communities such as Rebooting the WOT, Internet Identity Workshop and the w3C. 
                    - The framework we are building on is Holochain which factors in this research and takes an "agent centric" approach to data integrity that is privacy by design; the data is stored on the device and not revealed to third parties in the public space (DHT) without consent.
                - B)
                    - We are building on a framework called Holochain which is a data integrity layer written in Rust that adopts privacy by design, and agent-centric approaches to distributed p2p networking. 
                    - Holochain leverages research that has a lineage dating back in Xerox Parc and has continued in multiple communities such as Rebooting the WOT, Internet Identity Workshop and the W3C. Specifically, the work most relevant to our project is the DID standard. 
                - C)
                    - We are building on a framework called Holochain which is a data integrity layer adopting privacy by design, and agent-centric approaches to distributed p2p networking. We will implement sybil proof identity on it, similar to the BrightID reference implementation.
                    - This framework leverages research dating back to Xerox Parc, which later continued in multiple communities such as Rebooting the WOT, Internet Identity Workshop and the W3C. Work most relevant to our project is the DID standard.
        - [x] **Technology description **

            - Response
                - The technology our project leverages is a Web of Trust called Holochain. It's a Rust framework that can be thought of in terms of a graph database - entries and links. Hardware devices run agents which store their own ledgers or "source chains" containing key pairs that link to other data structures such as access rights. Connections can be established via P2P messaging or can be shared publicly in a distributed hash table through a network of nodes/devices.

            - Response
                - A)
                    - We fit into open innovation program as we enable rapid prototyping for many of the verticals. Most solutions will not scale effectively without identity and a social graph, which we enable bottom up.
                - B)
                    - We enable rapid prototyping and wide deployment by giving citizens back control of their connections and data, pluralising the solution space for local problems.
        - [x] **Will your product/service improve citizens' control over their data? **
            - Options

                - Yes
        - [x] **How will your product/service improve citizens' control over their data? ** 
            - We are leveraging an agent-centric ecosystem in which users store and maintain control over all their data. For citizens, this technology is inherently privacy by design and fully GDPR compliant!

            - Response
                - Forbes envision meshed ecosystems as the next evolution in the "future of work" - which we are enabling this through "pluggable" social graphs. If a client wants a custom experience for their network, a service can easily be built leveraging this user owned data. To this end, we can work with any client that wants to integrate social networking. More specifically we are targeting complex networks and ecosystems such as Odyssey Hackathon and institutes like the Gates Foundation or Stanford

            - Description
                - Indicate the current state of the market you are trying to conquer, ways you can learn from it and your alternative solutions.  After that, indicate the level of scalability of your project, and tell us about your approach to attract targeted clients, especially what channels your are planning on useing(e.g. online sales, retail, partners, vendors, etc.) To conclude: what are the main features  of your product/service that will attract growth? (max 1000 characters)
            - Response
                - A)
                    - Our approach is bottom up. We are already a network (Hackalong.io) with users - many of which are participants or stake holders in other networks such as Odyssey/[[Akasha]]. Within the Holochain ecosystem many applications are being built which can leverage identity and our social graph. Our core business will be white-labelling opinionated UI/UX customisations for partner networks once network effects demonstrate value.
                    - Currently the market we plan to conquer is dominated by Kumu; a for profit centralised and static Web2.0 solution. Our project builds similar tooling on a Web4.0 framework, allowing maps to be connected and brought to life with fresh data. Our focus however, is social graphs.
                    - The solution is highly scalable in the respect to both business and technology. From a business perspective we are able to tackle many horizontals once we lay the infrastructure. From a technology perspective Holochain gets faster as we add more nodes by attracting more users. 
                - B)
                    - Our approach is as a bottom up collective intelligence. We are part of a network called Hackalong.io, established through engaging in work with many stakeholders from various communities. As such we have a deep reach in the web3 world amongst many others, not to mention the potential for compounded network effects if we become the a primary identity provider in the Holochain ecosystem. 
                    - In regards to institutions it will be a matter of leveraging this growing ecosystem, as well as events like Odyssey to gain clients. The current market incumbent is Kumu a ten person team servicing high profile customers like Stanford so it's hoped that the added value of living data and extensibility will get them to switch. With Holoport servers bridging between old and new internet our technical scale is theoretically unlimited. On the business side we have many potential channels and in roads through our aggregated networks.
                - C)
                    - Digital identity is a necessity; the provider space is primed to explode and Forbes is predicting the rise of meshed ecosystems. New legislation is enabling paradigms like autonomous objects, digital twins, the physical internet and IOT. Demand for web-of-trust technology is expanding as institutions see the benefit, as we note with Sovrin and British Columbia.  
                    - From all this emergence however, we've observed that no one is doing identity from the bottom up on a human centric infrastructure. We are integrating learnings from asymmetrical top down approaches with bottom up connectivity and communities and levels the playing field. 
                    - In accordance with the practice of human centred design, we will utilise our own community for participatory action research, user testing and pilots. This is also how we intend to create a user base; by seeding connections in our network and partnering with other ecosystems through white labelling experiences and business logic for them.
                        - In parallel we will also seek institutional customers through participation in other networks like the Odyssey.org hackathon and can monetise by white labelling products for them.
        - [x] **Business model **
            - Description
                - Explain to us your business model. How do you plan to commercialise your product and accumulate shared gains for the entire ecosystems impacted by it? (max 500)
            - Response
                - A)
                    - The expertise we gain by creating a market infrastructure for graph mobility can be used for consultancy and services like building customized solutions for enterprise users interested in integrating it into their business logic. The shared gains 
                - B)
                    - We will sell services and consultation. Services are applications running on the generalised infrastructure with custom UI/UX flows. Consultation is mapping networks/onboarding for clients. Anyone in the ecosystem can do this work as the code is [[Open Source]]. 
                    - Additionally our graph (with extended capabilities) enables reputation networks to be built, and therefore many novel currencies and distribution methods may also follow.
                - C)
                    - We are building social infrastructure that enables rapid prototyping and on this infrastructure many custom applications and experiences can be built. Because the code is open it creates a symmetrical market for anyone willing to this work. 
                    - We will leverage experience gained from building the core infrastructure to attract consultation from enterprise clients for whom we can then deliver white labelled business logic or custom experiences.

                - Response
                    - We have most of the resources and experience that we need in house, however we function as part of a larger network which is charged with capacity, so we intend to make use of this opportunity.
                    - We are dedicating two full time staff to the project while others are allocated to the contracting budget. It's necessary to keep co-creating with strategic communities (like Blumorpho or [[Dyne]]) so travel and marketing reflects this. The technology budget covers any potentially necessary tooling costs.
