### Distributed sense-making and open [[Supply Chain]] for the hemp industry
- Local first coordination software for resource accounting
	- Built on a body of preexisting and proven research ([[REA]] Accounting)
	- Built on an unenclosable and [[Open Source]] protocol ([[Holochain]])
- Create multi-stakeholder coherence
	- "Web of Trust" security model (consent based)
		- GDPR compliant and privacy by design 
		- Peer interaction is reciprocal and relationally sensitive (private)
	- Sharing of information and capabilities can be incentivised
	- Find each other
### [[Supply Chain]] mapping 
- Find each other! Despite significant growth, the hemp industry is fraught with emerging and nascent market inefficiencies. It's difficult and expensive to create and monetise on the variety of Hemps end products because producers, consumers and processing facilities are scattered around and often invisible to each-other. Happily this coordination issue of imperfect information can be improved upon.
- Given the Hemp industries complex and multi-stakeholder nature, the manner in which issues are addressed needs to consider a variety of perspectives. Participants want to transparently find each-other for economic exchange while at the same time balancing this with privacy and control over personally identifying information - due to both GDPR regulations and the turbulent  regulatory space in which the participants find themselves. 
- The turbulent regulatory environment creates uncertainty and risk, which in turn creates opaque supply chains where many industry participants remain unknown. This lack of transparency creates all kinds of market inefficiencies and difficulties that burden the hemp industry. 
- Luckily, these industry teething issues can be mitigated though developments in todays tooling by embracing human centric and distributed technology. Open source protocols make vendor lock-in impossible because data is portable, and the software is non proprietary. This means the foundations are extensible and adaptive enough to meet an ever growing list of industry needs at various shades of transparency. 
- Because access to information is confidential it incentivises relationship  building by sharing information amongst trusted parties which can lead to significant operating efficiencies leading to increased transparency
