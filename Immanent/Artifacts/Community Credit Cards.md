# Community Credit Cards
- This solution is transparent: people just need to use a card as they always do.
- Every member receives a card. These can be used via mobile app for local exchanges.
- The card can also be used in normal pin machines.
- Every time a purchase is made using the card, preloaded money is withdrawn from the account.
- If, however, the person has fulfilled tasks for the community (community euros), these can be spent
- The principal difference of using this system over the traditional one is that a complementary currency is created within the system, hence the price and economic  participation is not bound by the presence of fiat currency in the location.
- This has profound ramifications, as the community is both incentivized to relocalize the economy (you will spend less if you  use your credit to source things within your community)
