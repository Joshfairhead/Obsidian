- General thought articulated
    - After smoking a joint up at the house with some music on, and then upon going down to the plane to build a fire I noticed that while breaking branches, I was still hearing the music from upstairs in my head - a time delta or reverberation from the past. 

My friend later asked me why I haven't been much interested in psychs and have passed them up a number of times recently. I gave it some thought and came up with the neural annealing answer; I'd like to wait for my internal and external worlds to quiet down as much as possible first to find as present a moment as possible, before setting my state through neural annealing (psychs etc.) to then ride the wave as long as I can. 

This annealing thought paired with the earlier one that we are perhaps some form of Helmholtz resonator in time, made me think of annealing in the context of setting the early reflections of a reverb units impulse response. In plain language, neural annealing (psychs) seem analogous to setting the delay time of a reverb units first reflection... which then colours the tail.

While synthesising theses thoughts, I reflected on how unbelievably slow Osho and other guru types talk (if you've ever watched him or others on youtube). One breath, one word is also a Zen aphorism I believe. As such I came to wonder if thats the game some of these sage types are playing with all the intense meditation (also a form of annealing); getting as still as possible and as close to the present moment as they can so ones causal reverberations can be heard and interpreted with minimal colouration?

- Neural annealing
- Impulse response
- First reflections = distance from the present moment
- Meditative silence 
- Flavor of Causality
- Are the rocks alive?
	- Autopoietic universe = unlimited bandwidth?
	- Signals from pulsars as language
