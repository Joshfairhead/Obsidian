### Primer on Logic

"Coins are metallic" ([[Propositions Triad]])
- Coins: **Subject** of the proposition
- Are: **Coupla**
- Metallic: **Predicate** or that which is affirmed

A **subject** is the name of a thing, or class of things contained among the more numerous things - of which the **predicate** is the name. (e.g. Josh is human; subject, coupla, predicate). Therefore a predicate is the class of which an instation comes from. More concretely; I must be a human to be a Josh!

- Propositions can be negative: the rocks NOT flammible (the rocks are not of the class flammible).
- Propositions can be hypothetical: if the stoves on, it will scald you.
