# Interaction Monad

### [[Forrest Landry]]
> All experience and expression (interaction) is known and understood in the terms of choice, change, and cause.

>The beingness and reality of (the doing of) a/any/the/all worlds/selves is composed completely and entirely of only change, causality, and choice. Change, causality, and choice are the composition and basis of all-that-is.

>The notion of 'real/reality' is defined, and has its basis in (only) change, causality, and choice.

>**Causality** is defined as the subjective perception (context) of a consistency between two objective contents.

>**Choice** is defined as the objective expression (content) of a consistency between two subjective contexts.

>**Change** refers to the continuity of content and asymmetry of context of the interaction/definition of the subjective and objective.

>- Change has the nature of the immanent modality.  
>- Causality has the nature of the omniscient modality.  
>- Choice has the nature of the transcendent modality.

> - The notion of Change is deeply connected to the concepts of complexity and consciousness, which are also of the immanent modality.  
> - The notion of Causality is deeply connected to the concepts of actuality and conservation, which are also of the omniscient modality.  
> - The notion of Choice is deeply connected to the concepts of potentiality and evolution, which are also of the transcendent modality.
