Up a scale: [[Trancendental]]

#### [[Forrest Landry]]
> The meaning of objectivity has common basis with the meaning of 'that which is perceived or is perceivable' (physical content).

> The meaning of 'objectivity' is to make an assertion that the transcendent modal aspects of a given set of interactions are common and shared for all of those interactions. 

> **Objectivity** is the product of the degree of  
> 1) the intensity of the self-to-world interaction,  
> 2) the degree of macroscopic consistency of the self-to-world interaction, and  
> 3) the degree of microscopic potentiality in the self-to-world interaction

> The concept of 'real' (perception) is inherently simple (an instance).  
> The concept of 'reality' (experience) is inherently complex (a class).
