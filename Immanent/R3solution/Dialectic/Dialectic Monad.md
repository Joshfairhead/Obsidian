> [[Logic]], which could be considered to include dialectic, was one of the three liberal arts taught in medieval universities as part of the [[trivium]] the other elements were [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]]

> Aristotle stresses that rhetoric is closely related to dialectic. He offers several formulas to describe this affinity between the two disciplines: first of all, rhetoric is said to be a "counterpart" (antistrophos) to dialectic (Rhet. I.1, 1354a1); (ii) it is also called an "outgrowth" (paraphues ti) of dialectic and the study of character (Rhet. I.2, 1356a25f.); finally, Aristotle says that rhetoric is part of dialectic and resembles it (Rhet. I.2, 1356a30f.). In saying that rhetoric is a counterpart to dialectic, Aristotle obviously alludes to Plato's Gorgias (464bff.), where rhetoric is ironically defined as a counterpart to cookery in the soul. Since, in this passage, Plato uses the word 'antistrophos' to designate an analogy, it is likely that Aristotle wants to express a kind of analogy too: what dialectic is for the (private or academic) practice of attacking and maintaining an argument, rhetoric is for the (public) practice of defending oneself or accusing an opponent. The analogy to dialectic has important implications for the status of rhetoric. Plato argued in his Gorgias that rhetoric cannot be an art (technÃª), since it is not related to a definite subject, while real arts are defined by their specific subjects, as e.g. medicine or shoemaking are defined by their products, i.e., health and shoes

> This dialectic (a _quaestio disputata_) was formed as follows:
> 1.  The question to be determined ("It is asked whether...");
> 2.  A provisory answer to the question ("And it seems that...");
> 3.  The principal arguments in favor of the provisory answer;
> 4.  An argument against the provisory answer, traditionally a single argument from authority ("On the contrary...");
> 5.  The determination of the question after weighing the evidence ("I answer that...");
> 6.  The replies to each of the initial objections. ("To the first, to the second etc., I answer that...")
