# Dialectic Triad

| 3 | 6 | 9 |
|---|---|---|
| Thesis | Anti-thesis | Synthesis | <- Kant (believe it or not)
| Abstract | Negative | Concrete | <- Hegel (interesting arrangement)

Note that Hegel has a strange order. 
3: Abstract is proposition
6: Negative removes from the abstract
9: Concrete is the objective result of the transformation that reconciles
