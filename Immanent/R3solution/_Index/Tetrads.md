> - _Polycategorical_ ontologies are concerned with the categories of being. Each polycategorical ontology posits a number of categories. These categories are exclusive and exhaustive: every existing entity belongs to exactly one category.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#cite_note-Schaffer-75) A recent example of a polycategorical ontology is [E.J. Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.J._Lowe "E.J. Lowe")'s four-category-ontology.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#cite_note-Lowe-78) The four categories are object, kind, mode and attribute. The fourfold structure is based on two distinctions. The first distinction is between substantial entities (objects and kinds) and non-substantial entities (modes and attributes). The second distinction is between particular entities (objects and modes) and universal entities (kinds and attributes). Reality is built up through the interplay of entities belonging to different categories: particular entities instantiate universal entities, and non-substantial entities characterize substantial entities
