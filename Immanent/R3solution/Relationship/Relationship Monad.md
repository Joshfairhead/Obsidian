> it seen to be more correct to use the term 'interaction' when considering 'what happens between' self and reality, rather than just the static notion of 'relation'. As such, the concepts of objectivity and subjectivity are defined in terms of the relationship between self and reality, and that the notion of relationship is expanded to include the notions of 'interaction', 'perception', and 'expression'.
