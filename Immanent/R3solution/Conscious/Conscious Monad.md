# Conscious Monad

> It can also imply that a person is aware of a particular fact or feeling, such as an investor who is conscious of risk or athletes who are conscious of being role models for young people. Another common meaning of _conscious_ describes a person who cares about something specified, such as the cost-conscious shopper and the environmentally conscious activist. Additionally, _conscious_ can modify an act or decision that is done deliberately (and one that might very well result in _conscious_ guilt or a guilty _conscience_).
