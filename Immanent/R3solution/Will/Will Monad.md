> #### Schopenhauer

Arthur Schopenhauer was a proponent of metaphysical voluntarism he regards will as the underlying and ultimate reality. Reality as a whole consists only of one will, which is equated with the Kantian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian "Kantian") [thing-in-itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself "Thing-in-itself"). Like the Kantian thing-in-itself, the will exists outside space and time. But, unlike the Kantian thing-in-itself, the will has an experiential component to it: it comes in the form of striving, desiring, feeling, etc.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#cite_note-144)[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#cite_note-145) The manifold of things we encounter in our everyday experiences, like trees or cars, are mere appearances that lack existence independent of the observer. Schopenhauer describes them as objectivations of the will. These objectivations happen in different "steps", which correspond to the [platonic forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_forms "Platonic forms").[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#cite_note-146) All objectivations are grounded in the will. This grounding is governed by the [principium individuationis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principium_individuationis "Principium individuationis"), which enables a manifold of individual things spread out in space and time to be grounded in the one will.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology#cite_note-Kastrup-147)
