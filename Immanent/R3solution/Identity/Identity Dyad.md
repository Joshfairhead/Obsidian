# Identity Dyad

| Essence | Existance |
|---|---|
| Being | Will |
| Function | Object |
| Essence | Avatar |

%% Nonsense
| Being | Doing |
| Is | Acting |
| Singular | Collective |
| Integrative | Divicive | 
%%

#### Note
- It feels as if [[John Bennet]]s framework is primarily about identity and that Essence/Existance is the definition of an identity. 
- It feels as if Identity is the same as [[Forrest Landry]]s domain. 
- Ergo Identity is Domain; same thing.
