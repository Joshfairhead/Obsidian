# R3solution
## What 
R3solution is a semantic library. It is a framework built on a collection of modal attractors, triples at first. It's forseen that these triples can be used for a number of useful purposes as the semantic web emerges. R3solution is simply a language and will remain a library



## How
These triples are constructed of three terms in order to triangulate the significance of its meaning in semantic space. 

The foundation of the library is based on the principal of `fundemental triplication`, which states that any domain can be described to necessary and sufficient degrees with three terms. 

Each term has a modal characteristic; an eigenvalue that words are attracted towards.
