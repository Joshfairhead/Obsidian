# R3solution
## What 
R3solution is a **passive** semantic library. It's a framework consisting of modal attractors which are forseen to be useful for a number of purposes as the semantic web emerges on [[Holochain]]. R3solution is a curated lexicon of linked modes and relationships; a reference language for building other applications. 

Potential applications:
- Semantic search
- Training data for AI agents
- Natural language processing
- Reference library for other applications

## How
Through a structured framework of interconnected modal attractors we can increase semantic resolution. The foundations of any domain can be described to necessary and sufficient degrees through `fundemental triplication`; a collection of three terms in different modalities which triangulate the mode or feel of a term. 

Triples are not the only structure available but due to their ability to cover a domain in its entirity, they are desirable initial conditions. While triples have great `extensionality` they have relativly poor `intentionality`. 

As higher order systems contain exponentially more terms and relationships between terms, we can say that they have an increased `intensionality` and thus greater semantic r3solution. This increased clarity makes the higher order systems particularly desirable to articulate as they become more pragmatic and applicable, however due to their decreased `extensionality` there is a greater quantity of them to enumerate. 

## Why
Because not everyone has access to this degree of metaphysics. This is significant as metaphysical descriptions are narratives which in turn limit, or delimit, the possibility space we have access to. The broader and deeper the metaphysics, the greater access to potential we have. This library raises noetic capacity.

In more concrete terms though, the semantic web is emerging and we will need to bootstrap it from somewhere. This library will hopefully become that corner stone from which accurate semantic systems can be built. 

## Ethics
We are drowning in a sea of noise, with signal scarce and scant. Big tech has colonised the internet and it's time that it was deterritorialised. While this vendor lock in may seem ok at first glance (they give us free tools), it's equivelent to infiltrating and colonosing your mind by prescribing a symbol set.
