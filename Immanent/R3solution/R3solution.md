# R3solution
## What 
R3solution is a **passive** semantic library. It's a framework consisting of modal attractors which are forseen to be useful for a number of purposes as the semantic web emerges. It is a curated lexicon of linked modes and relationships; a reference language in the form of a resourse for consumption. 

Potential applications:
- Semantic search
- Training data for AI agents
- Natural language processing
- Reference library for other applications

## How
Through a structured framework of interconnected modal attractors semantic resolution is increased. The foundations of any domain can be described to necessary and sufficient degrees through `fundemental triplication`; a collection of three terms in different modalities which triangulate the mode or feel of a term. The relationships between these terms also have a mode and feel.

Triples are not the only semantic structure available, but due to their ability to cover a domain in its entirity - they are desirable foundations to build upon. While triples have an all encompassing `extensionality`, they have relativly shallow `intentionality`. 

As higher order systems contain more terms and exponentially more relationships between terms, we can say that they have an increased `intensionality` and thus greater r3solution. This clarity makes the higher order systems particularly desirable to articulate, as they become more pragmatic and applicable, however due to their decreased `extensionality` there is a greater quantity of them to enumerate. 

Worth noting is the emphasis on the active tense. 

## Why
Because not everyone has access to this degree of metaphysics, nor knows how to use them. Metaphysical descriptions are narratives which limit (or delimit) our possibility space. The broader and deeper the metaphysics; the greater access we have to optionality and potential. This library thus raises noetic capacity.

In more concrete terms; the semantic web is emerging and we will need to bootstrap it from somewhere. This library will hopefully become the corner stone from which semantically compatible systems can be built. Like a search engine that works! 

## Ethics
It seems like we are drowning in a sea of noise, with signal scarce and scant but distraction everywhere. Big tech has colonised the internet and it's time that it was deterritorialised. While this vendor lock in may seem ok at first glance (they give us free tools), the game of capture and mind control through **prescriptive** symbol sets is antiethical to life. 

This library describes it's own form as a framework but leaves the door wide open by maximising it's affordances. It is general and **descriptive** but if one so chooses, they may apply it prescriptivly as it has many implications and potential uses.
