# Participation On Chain
Technologically speaking, the Regen Network is a blockchain ledger. The integrity of data stored on the ledger is secured by agents known as 'validators'. Validators are technology stewards who maintain the distributed leder infrastructure by running the Regen Ledger software (and maintianing a consensus mechanism) in order to secure the network at a fundemental level. 

The `consensus mechanism` used on Regen Network is known as `delegated Proof of Stake`. `Proof of stake` means that anyone acting as a validator `stakes` or risks their tokens in order to secure the ledger. If a validator acts dishonestly by modifying their account of events they will be automatically penalised and loose their tokens. There is thus an economic incentive for validators to act honestly. Token holders can then either 'vote' or 'delegate' their tokens to validators in order to earn rewards. 

This tutorial outlines how to participate in token voting and delegation.

To participate in onchain governance, participants first need REGEN tokens. There are numerous ways that to get hold of these and accrual of of tokens is beyond the scope of this tutorial. For illistrutive purposes though they may be obtained from a friend, bought on the market, recieved through EnDAOment or in renumeration for some other ecosystem service (such as validator staking rewards).

Assuming you wish to participate in this digital ecosystem, how do you do so?
