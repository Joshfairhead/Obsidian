### Commonwealth Sign-up
- Start by setting up your wallet and making a test transaction as described 
- Discussions live on commonwealth.im/regen so go there as first stop.
- Clicking the `Log in` button in the top right of the screen to get started.
- You are then presented with a number of options; Email, Github, Discord & Wallet.
- While you can technically log-in with any of these options, you can't do much without a wallet address so its best to just select the wallet option. You can associate other profiles later if you choose. 
- Assuming you have Keplr installed and then select the wallet option you'll be able to Keplr in the drop down menu. 
- Upon doing so Commonwealth will ask you to select an address; it's likely you only have one at this stage so select it.
- This will open your wallet and ask you to sign a transaction of 0 $REGEN, worth $0. 
- Select approve and you'll be logged in. 
- You can now interact with the forum by responding to threads, starting new ones, making proposals or voting on them.
