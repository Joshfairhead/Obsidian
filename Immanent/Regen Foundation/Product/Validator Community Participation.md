## Command Line Interface Proposals
The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that allows users to access all the back end functions of a given application; in our case the 'application' is the Regen Ledger. We will look at the proposal functionality.

Four types of CLI proposal:  
- Simple text proposal
- Paramater change proposal
- Software upgrade proposal
- Community spend proposal
