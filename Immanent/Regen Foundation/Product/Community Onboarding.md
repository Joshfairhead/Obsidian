## Open community Onboarding Process
- A desire to participate in emitted on a community platform or other channels
- Community member is connected with a point of contact in the ecosysetem
- An orientation process occurs through socialisation in a public space (office hours, community campfire)
- During this orientation the new participant meets others working on projects
- The new participant finds a project to work on
- When work is near completion they socialise it with other teams
- Work is finalised
- New member is onboarded

Note: measures should include community members that initiate onboarding, the number of finalised artefacts and the drop off rate.
