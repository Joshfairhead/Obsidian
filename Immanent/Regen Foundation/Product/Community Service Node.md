# Community Service Node
## ToDos
- [ ] Learning resources feedback mechanism
- [x] Proof of Stake explainer
- [ ] The community calls should be an in-sync equivalent to the Commonwealth forum. I also propose that we make this clear during the next instance of the calls with an invite for community facilitators and prepare for a timeline to transition to community facilitation by the end of this quarter.
- [ ] [Community Pool Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWVIK9kfzK6LSdTxyETGR3G-1wBHU2PuEmiLftjehGo/edit#heading=h.8xazka33dvw3)
- [ ] It would be great to introduce OpenTEAM as an enDAOed community and mention the current events in the pipeline. Who should be looped into that [@Sienna Zuco](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02BGBCFXT6)?  [@Josh Fairhead](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02QPQF8RR7), can you work with [@Sienna Zuco](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02BGBCFXT6) to make that happen for both the community calls and loop in [@Gijs Spoor](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02CW3QL21M) too please?
- [ ] An off-cycle Twitter Space or enDAOment community highlight to introduce OpenTEAM would be great and look at potential partnering projects would be great. [@Josh Fairhead](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02QPQF8RR7) can you set this up and prioritize this as part of the Twitter Spaces planned please?
- [ ] It would be great if you come in with a proposal to the Thursday call, Josh and clarify how this ties in with enDAOment and the next scope of your contract. I am not yet fully clear on the purpose of the community service center. Onboarding the DAOs, organizing the calls and engaging the validators is clearly a need at the moment though and I'd like to see how the two tie in together.Please also clarify the nature of engagement if you want to bring Chris on board so the roles are crystal clear, Josh.
- [ ] enDAOment AMA Twitter Spaces
- [ ] [@Josh Fairhead](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02QPQF8RR7) Is there a place where you have clarified the scope of the community service center and it's evolution? I'm especially keen to know how it meets/will evolve to meet the needs of the enDAOment candidates and those who need a primer to the Cosmos  and Regen ecosystem in general.I'd see [@Anastasios Grigoriadis](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U03BEF2MQ4U) as one of them.
- [ ] To me, a Town Hall is the space where validators, representatives for stakeholders from across the Regen ecosystem come together specifically for decision-making, announcements.
- [ ] Pointed specific questions in an async request also works for the next time FWIW. It also seems to me that a regular sync with Gijs and the enDAOment communities to review their feedback and add that to the list of resources and the roadmap would be great.I'd see enDAOment-related onboarding deliverables, resources and processes being a priority right now. Gijs is planning the curriculum for the enDAOed communities which should reflect the needs better. [@Austin Wade Smith](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02KNM2N3SL) do you have a link to the updated version for Josh to look at?I'd also note the need for:  
- [ ] A direct feedback loop with the enDAOment community representatives as well - A process and cadence of check-in and review for instance.
- [ ] A roadmap where enDAOment representatives and RF team members can directly weigh in and see the progress of the different resources. 



OpenTeam:
- [ ] It would be lovely to do a feature on OpenTEAM in the next newsletter. [@Emily](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02J6N6EM6V) can you work with [@Sienna Zuco](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02BGBCFXT6) on the content you would need to add them to the newsletter as well as add  them as an enDAOed community on our website?

## Call | Josh <> Revs | 11/04/2022

### Meeting Notes
-   Josh:
    -   We have a community call . What’s that supposed to be?
    -   The community call is actually a general circle. Seems like a larger blocker.
    -   Austin is taking it next week to socialize the enDAOment stuff - should become the general circle.
    -   A lot of work is people interaction - if we are all multi-sigs, one of the parts would be signing off on enDAOment choices to optimize the consortium structure. Slowing doing this through building calls into calls.
    -   What we have from the community call is a general circle moving up into the enDAOment circle. From there, we are moving into science, registry, etc that grows the consortium.
    -   Want a well-set up consortium structure and a well-functioning community as possible.
-   Revs:
    -   Consortium is non-crypto stakeholders.
-   Josh:
    -   Understanding on what I’m doing and how.
    -   Talking about the community call, what that is, why, the progression.
    -   The main reason is - Josh needs to set up the ground to do the job. Need to prime the soil before planting the seeds.
    -   Josh at the market, science and technology side. Austin on the planet, people, etc.
    -   Harnessing market, science and technology is the split in terms of partnerships, relationships, etc.
    -   Feel like should be setting up the consortium structure, can’t do that without the agency.
    

### Original Description and Responsibilities
The Protocol Governance Coordinator is crucial to the vision and mission of Regen Foundation to successfully and inclusively engage all stakeholders in the governance of the Regen Ledger supporting the [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/). Inspired by the work of [Audrey Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang), the goal is to make the technology and processes behind the network governance inclusive and easily accessible.
-   Work with validators, community members, our sister organization [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/). And other network participants to steward a network-sourced roadmap for the development of governance upgrades
-   Coordinate and support network governance proposals
-   Determine, design and oversee governance tools designed to engage the underrepresented (such as [Fish Vote](https://www.fish.vote/) in Uniswap)
-   Onboard the community to the governance tools including onboarding them to the use of the governance module, the group modules, setting up and getting familiar with the Regen wallets.
-   Support community engagement on social media and tools like Discord working closely with the community manager from the sister organization [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/).
-   Communicate ledger protocol governance updates to the stakeholders
-   Contribute content to the blogs and social media reflecting the philosophy of the organization.

## Call: Josh <> Revathi 14/12/21
## Meeting Agenda

### Potential Synergies
**Organisational**
-   Process modelling; using Statebox to model and optimise internal processes with applied category theory.
-   H3 University & Governance design; a wealth of experience building adaptive organisations through the implementation of anticipatory governance. This work ties into fractal organisation (circles) and intentional futures work to inform operations and strategy (viable systems).
-   Open Team & 2030. I feel I still need more information on OpenTeams situation but from initial impressions it sounds like a service company I was helping to setup in 2018 might be the solution. The company was getting set up with the FCA (UK's SEC) to tokenise equity, especially for emerging ESG solutions. They take a small slice of the token allocation to nourish themselves for their work investment rather than charge fees (to my current knowledge).

**Educational and community**
-   Microsolidarity crew work; transforming a continuous flow of individuals into a continuous flow of small groups trough generative spaces. We've been working on a meta-framework based on Christopher Alexander's work on unfolding wholeness and optimising for "life" (aka maximising affordances). It would probably serve as a good blueprint for designing educational programmes and other spaces that allow for "other ways of knowing".

**Ecosystem and outreach**
-   Hackathons; Odyssey platform/alliances.
-   Strategic profile picture of myself "beating their drum" on foundation website?
    -   Sovereign Nature Initiative hackathon runs on the Odyssey platform
        -   Hackathon deadline on the 20th December.

## Call notes

-   Educational programme headed by Gijs is on hold while dealing with the government takeover of Auroville. We can flesh this out while he's away but he's taking the lead on that. Making it loosely coupled and composible sounded like a hurdle. This brought me back to the Microsolidarity work mentioned above as it's been designed in such a manner. Further to this it sounded like it would probably find resonance with Austin due to his educational/architectural background. The group has opted to introduce this work to others by offering experiential readings; I'm happy to foster exploration if anyone wishes to receive the offer.
-   Governance circle approved. This is a platform for which I've been given mandate to foster; it's exact form is unshaped as of yet and I'll be an initial steward of the circle. This means prefiguring the space and then integrating feedback. Revathi expressed a desire to take a consent based approach; receiving a proposal with initial outlines, plans and other bits of critical information before starting implementation. This should take variety into account and consider what agents want and how they fit.
-   Ledger Governance Coordination; this is about platform design (should clarify scope). On reflection it seems that the above paragraph should be nested as a subsection of this role? Regardless, what I heard in our discussion was that the foundation needs a community face for the ledger/wallet to support community onboarding and help people understand the nuts and bolts of token delegation, validators and their role in the ecosystem as well as making potential power dynamics explicit and transparent. This is about stewarding the community campfire and helping non-technical members make sense of the world they are entering/involved with.
    -   Of particular interest is how the community integrates with the Regen Registry and the network health metrics.
        -   Will is most involved with the treasury (delegation, management, validators). There are two wallets:
            -   EnDAOment (30m Tokens + staking rewards)
            -   Validators (5m Tokens + staking rewards)
    -   A desire to foster relationships between validators and the foundation was also expressed.
    -   Revathi expressed a desire to eventually transition the Regen Registry to a DAO which would then support the role via a community pool.
