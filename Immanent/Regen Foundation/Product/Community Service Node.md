# Community Service Node
## ToDos
- [ ] Learning resources feedback mechanism
- [x] Proof of Stake explainer
- [ ] The community calls should be an in-sync equivalent to the Commonwealth forum. I also propose that we make this clear during the next instance of the calls with an invite for community facilitators and prepare for a timeline to transition to community facilitation by the end of this quarter.
- [ ] [Community Pool Proposal Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWVIK9kfzK6LSdTxyETGR3G-1wBHU2PuEmiLftjehGo/edit#heading=h.8xazka33dvw3)
- [ ] It would be great to introduce OpenTEAM as an enDAOed community and mention the current events in the pipeline. Who should be looped into that [@Sienna Zuco](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02BGBCFXT6)?  [@Josh Fairhead](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02QPQF8RR7), can you work with [@Sienna Zuco](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02BGBCFXT6) to make that happen for both the community calls and loop in [@Gijs Spoor](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02CW3QL21M) too please?
- [ ] An off-cycle Twitter Space or enDAOment community highlight to introduce OpenTEAM would be great and look at potential partnering projects would be great. [@Josh Fairhead](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02QPQF8RR7) can you set this up and prioritize this as part of the Twitter Spaces planned please?
- [ ] It would be great if you come in with a proposal to the Thursday call, Josh and clarify how this ties in with enDAOment and the next scope of your contract. I am not yet fully clear on the purpose of the community service center. Onboarding the DAOs, organizing the calls and engaging the validators is clearly a need at the moment though and I'd like to see how the two tie in together.Please also clarify the nature of engagement if you want to bring Chris on board so the roles are crystal clear, Josh.
- [ ] enDAOment AMA Twitter Spaces
- [ ] [@Josh Fairhead](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02QPQF8RR7) Is there a place where you have clarified the scope of the community service center and it's evolution? I'm especially keen to know how it meets/will evolve to meet the needs of the enDAOment candidates and those who need a primer to the Cosmos  and Regen ecosystem in general.I'd see [@Anastasios Grigoriadis](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U03BEF2MQ4U) as one of them.
- [ ] To me, a Town Hall is the space where validators, representatives for stakeholders from across the Regen ecosystem come together specifically for decision-making, announcements.
- [ ] Pointed specific questions in an async request also works for the next time FWIW. It also seems to me that a regular sync with Gijs and the enDAOment communities to review their feedback and add that to the list of resources and the roadmap would be great.I'd see enDAOment-related onboarding deliverables, resources and processes being a priority right now. Gijs is planning the curriculum for the enDAOed communities which should reflect the needs better. [@Austin Wade Smith](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02KNM2N3SL) do you have a link to the updated version for Josh to look at?I'd also note the need for:  
- [ ] A direct feedback loop with the enDAOment community representatives as well - A process and cadence of check-in and review for instance.
- [ ] A roadmap where enDAOment representatives and RF team members can directly weigh in and see the progress of the different resources. 



OpenTeam:
- [ ] It would be lovely to do a feature on OpenTEAM in the next newsletter. [@Emily](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02J6N6EM6V) can you work with [@Sienna Zuco](https://regenfoundation.slack.com/team/U02BGBCFXT6) on the content you would need to add them to the newsletter as well as add  them as an enDAOed community on our website?
