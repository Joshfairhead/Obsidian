## Check-in:
- What's alive in your body right now? What are the sensations your aware of?
- How are you feeling? Whats your emotional intelligence saying to you?
- Whats on your mind? What thoughts need to be dissipated through expression to experience a thinner present moment?

### Agency vs Determinism:
This workshop has taken an intentional divergence from the previously planned and pre-determined session. As agency only exists in the face of uncertainty; clock master chronos has been thrown out the window and the workshops has been reconfigured to enable something new to come into being. 

#### Instead I've outlined a rough discussion:
- Lets talk about our conversationational capacity and how we play together and pass the ball amongst us as a team!

##### Framing: Social poetry
>Social poetry is **poetry which performs a social function or contains a level of social commentary**.

###### Further resolution 
- Interactions inform experience from which expressions emerge. 
- The flavour of these experiences and expressions are ultimately up to us.
- This is determined through by our internalised frames and frameworks.

###### Interaction patterns
- It's impossible not to show up; but authentically doing so is often constrained by our enviorment and life cirucmstances. What 'rights' do we grant ourselves, so that we may grant them to others?

###### A Menu of Examples
- Seen in the wild at Regen:
	- Session setup: What game are we playing; facillitated/unfacillitated. Breathe, popcorn ect. 
	- Check-ins
	- Popcorn
	- Gratitude
- Other perspectives
	- Hand signals
		- Game shifting
			- ![Gameshifting](assets/Gameshifting.jpg)
			-  ![Gameshifting Full](assets/gameshiftingfull.png)
	- Language
		- Language as 'Commerce' (or 'Correspondence')
			- Buying (correspondence)
				- Ecology of Questions (by order of importance)
					- Why
					- How
					- What
					- Where
					- When
			- Selling (commerce)
				- Ecology of speech acts
					- Affirmations
					- Accusations
					- Demonstration
					- Commissives
					- Declaritives
		- Mode / Mood
			- Imperatives vs Optatives
	- Our relationship with time
		- Clocks
		- Calendars
		- Deadlines
		- Commitments
		- Deep work
		- Space before and after calls to enable presence
		- 20% Time
			- Reflection
			- Contemplation
			- Meditation
- Prompt
	- What other kinds of interaction patterns can we use to delimit our constraints so as to invite and enable our alive, vital and creative energies to flourish? 


## Notes

### Persona A (Austin)
- Metaphores we live by
- Language to scaffold how ideas can emerge
	- Capitalism and war embedded in english - structural violence
		- Spending / taking time (the ultimate currency, but framed capitalistically)
	- Win / loose a conversation frames it as a battle
	- Transactions; such as the idea of 'commerce'
- How do our metaphores guide us

### Persona B (Revs)
- Touches on how we relate to eachother and the org as a team; three things that jump out:
	- Development psychology to inform structures
		- Robert Keegan 'level 5' requires entropy and unstructure
		- Level 4 is like a structured machine
		- Postulates level 4 and level 5 need integration as the transactional space
		- 4 structure is a nice fall back space that needs to accomidate level 5 emergenc
	- Language space being academic and comfortable for native english speakers but not necessarily so for other cultures; spelling it out for others to get on the same page.
		- Minimal set of understandood terms as explicit; not taking this is for granted with others in our interface with the community. How do we reduce this gap?
	- How do we keep track of goals and aspirations and not loose them?


### Persona C (Will)
- Language as spells. 
- Cultures in time have put much more **emphasis on what is said and NOT said, especially in certain cantexts**. What is said can invoke distopias, or be used accidently to influence the course of events. 
- Coming back to reverence with our words and their power 
- Semiotics and bio-semiotics 
- Communication and meaning making
- Thinking about the regeneration of living systems and what happens outside of language and words
- How we interact with non human entities
- Wordless poems to the other being 
	- Sharing poems was guessable by others even with out indication just by the shape of the sounds
	- Art as a language of gesture; play of light, shape of sounds - implicit communication that shows up in branding and the limited bandwidth of the written word

### Persona A (Austin)
 - One of the core things the foundation is creating a shared lexicon that can encompass variety. This is an exploration af literacy. 
 - There is a tendancy that when you say things, there is an implication of provinence and ownership as a result. How we recraft ownership via language?
 - How can we keep a reverence for the mnemonic form that lives in place, culture, nature
 - How is the landscape conserved in mnemonics; song lines conserve this in interesting forms. There are potentially many other forms that this can take.

### Persona B (Revs)
- Culturally important and held close to heart.
- Digital disparity; disruption of place
- Elders passing on stories in governace circles within some communities
- Elaborate cloths as communication encodings; ledgers that are passed on and creating historical record beyond words. Only certain people can encode and decode this information 

### Persona A (Austin)
- Practices of language waiting to grow and emerge. We are in a fruitful space to do this in relation to the land and growing new forms of social poetry
- Nice to visually represent Modes (facillitation vs non facillitator mode = Gameshifting)
- Self facillitation first, but seeing how conversations are defined by the structuring of framework. Being aware of whos structuring and scaffolding the space

### Persona C (Will)
- On Language
	- Inherent value vs rationality
	- Rationality and rhetoric are about comparison (epistemology and how we know something)
		- Scientific rationality relies on research and citations
		- Money strips out the multi faceted dimensionality and reduces it to a snigle number for the sake of balance sheet comparisons. An example of reductive rationality.
		- "Why does this matter" = justification and inherent epistemology
	- Setting us back into a relationship with ourself and why they (justifications?) matter inherently
		- How do we value a tree for its treeness?
	- Epistemology of rationality and rhetoric distance us from our rdirect relationship with being thing relationship and place

### Persona A (Austin)
- How do we make space for talking about markets and worlding in the space were occupying in relation to nature?
- In what ways are we producing insane dimensionality reduction and how do we get into a place thats mediates between our "rational" epistemology and 'non-rational' ways of knowing that practice humanhood
- How do we own up to our dimensionality reduction?

### Persona B (Revs)
- Dimensional reduction seen alot between real life and the digital space, very alive for Revs
- Digital representation is always a reduction. See: [[Nooscope.ai]]
