The Registry is a pretty key product in the Regen ecosystem; perhaps even the wider purpose of enDAOment depending on perspective. Currently the Registry is thinking about the Data and Groups modulse as well as workflows and feedback loops. 
- Foundation collects user stories (Gijs)
- Registry collects use cases from discord threads and conversations (Rebecca)
- Ledger gets informed (Josh) and helps translate with Tica for educational purposes
- LOA does the marketing

Product wise we talked about a non-natives guide to the data and groups modules; aka Verification and Governance chapters of the Registry Programme Guide. We also talked about Credit classes which fit in here. Josh and Tica are set to work these chapters out together, with Gijs and Ned hopefully informing.

As an aside a 'methodology DAO' is a potentiality when the groups module comes into existence. Web34Life may function as that container as a number of Methodology developers and Ontological designers (deSci drive) are turning up there.
