Things ave changed with commonstack regarding budget; no longer acting as a paid contributor but working to keeep the partnership going

Thiago and Austin got in the partnership post discussion but still a lot to define and design; been talking to November since Rebecca and Revathi were in contact and then got caught in the loop.

- Background in agronomy

Part of the role was to be the bridge with Austin; Cstack teeam doesnt have anyone with the background in regeneration. Needs to make rearrangements to get paid but continuing on as a contributor. 

Call with Austin was about bringing the communities closer between land and web3. Research in how landstewards and coops organise themselves / history of decision making and the relevant tools for these communities. Approaching both communities to find agreement. 

- CSA madel - not a coop. Incentivises paid up front to individuals and paid back in commodities which are then sold. 
- Has a network of small holders, coffee growers and other initiatives to bring into the fold and call on. (Gijs) They've met and have friends between them thats a professor Irene Cardoso in the university.
