# 2022-05-26 Newsletter

Happy Spring folks!

This newsletter is coming to you live from the ReFi Spring gathering in Portugal. As mentioned during the last community call we are undergoing some transformations so this weeks Community Call is cancelled while we reconfigure the format and purpose. Don't worry, we'll be back as soon as we've emerged from our crythasilis!

So yeah, whats alive? Being spring theres plenty popping up right now but since the CC is on break lets cover some of the movements in this offering. If you would be so kind as to sign up to this [link] we are consolidating our signalling into something a little less scrappy than your probably used to! 

Mmmmm, tasty design right? Theres a butterfly coming out - just look at the beautiful patterning!

### Earth Day and Working groups 
Ok, so Earth Day is coming up but here at the Foundation we are not satisfied with a single day so we're hosting a week instead! These Twitter spaces are, in a form, a call to action because we are hoping to form working groups around the core topics; please attend the sessions if you can but if not, no fomo - just express your interest via contact@regen.foundation and we'll tie you into their continuation.

So what have we got lined up for people?

- The kick off sessions will be on the ledger as the voice of planetary health - a session getting held by Foundation CEO Revathi Kollegia and RND founder Gregory Landua, with other Regenerati on the guest list as usual. It's gonna be alive and kicking, so whats coming is pretty hard to predict but speculativly speaking the session will probably include discussion on remote sensing, predictive modelling through baysian inferrance and turning measurements of free energy into crypto currencies - like our friends at Bioform labs are doing. [date and link]
- After that Small holder value chains are up and so we are takling with the folks from Ethic Hub about their supply chain and crypto microfinancing platform which pushes value right to the edges of of rural Mexico and beyond. This is non-theoretical impact and inclusion enabled by distributed ledger technology and coopreatives acting as digital intermediaries. [date and link]
- Last on the list is Governance through the lens of eco femenisim will then hosted by Nena form the foundations enDAOment team and community steward Jillian Hovey whos been self-funding her regenerative work in permaculture for over thirty years. [date and link]

### Ledger Governance Updates
Many technologists in our community will be aware of the CommonWealth platform we use to formalise decisions on chain but for those unaware of where important ecosystem wide discussions and decisions happen it's here! 

Community members request funding and community spends form this website. The blockchain validators then decide on outcomes by voting on the proposals. These representatives are incentivised to vote for proposals that benefit the wider network and the ecosystems token holding delegates - the largest of these being csDAOs. On that front we have two csDAOs delegating and are about to bring another six into existence so that community is growing rapidly at this point! 

So what are the important discussions happening there? Well, you should [visit the platform](https://commonwealth.im/regen/) and get involved for yourself but here's a summary of some discussions happening at the moment:
- [Adding credits to the Registry allow list.](https://commonwealth.im/regen/discussion/4959-adding-tokens-to-the-regen-ledger-currency-allow-list)
- [Validator Governance Draft Proposal](https://commonwealth.im/regen/discussion/4874-validator-governance-draft-proposal-for-discussion).

The former is a discussion on the paramaters of acceptible credit design; what are the considerations we need to reflect on in order to build a viable, vital and vivifying registry? What are considered regenerative currencies and what are not? Is a given currency interchain? Is it safe, liquid and stable?The discussion is pretty wide in scope but super important. Come discuss the criterea!

The latter is then a discussion around cohereing the validator ecosystem between the networks large token holders and community artisans in a generative way. Can we gather a consortium of these folks together to vitalise the viable system? Add your voice to the discussion!

### Newsletter sign up
As mentioned we are improving our signalling methodology. This network has so far been built on interpersonal relationships (replicating the p2p technology we are creating) so to date theres been no central point of coordination. To allievate the communicaion overhead we're going to continue sending out our important updates via the newsletter. If you would be so kind as to sign up we'll make sure to keep you looped in on happenings by broadcasting sailient information and events from this lighthouse.
