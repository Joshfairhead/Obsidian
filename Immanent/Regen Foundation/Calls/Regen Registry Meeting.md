# Regen Registry Meeting

- Adgenda:
	- Latest proposal

What is the registry, how are we decentralising and how are we different from other registrys

History
- Started last Feburary
- Quite similar to other programs originally 
	- Dictated the rules 
	- Same for running a project
	- Jumping through hoops
	- Top down

- Open ecosystem
	- Open to participation
		- Access to resources
	- Open to inputs at the meta level
	- Descriptive rather than prescriptive
	- Methodologies accepted so long as they are transparent about the model
	- Can nest methodology standerds
		- Options for filters; if not peer reviewed methodology then ok, just filtered
	- Different working groups, working on different standards
		- e.g. peer review DAO
	- Strategy to decentralise
		- Interface with community that appreciate the processes being articulated

 - Community call describing the registry
	 - Blog post and presentation on the registry

- Language issue 
	- Registry
	- Ledger
	- How is the registry conceptualised; is there a buyer and seller that meet. Is there a smart contract thats generating data. Liquidity pools; what mechanisms are at play. Who are the stakeholders? How much is automated
		- Tokens and credit classes are different
		- Credit classes are on chain representation of eco credits
			- Provides information about whos managing these on chain programs
			- AUTHORITY: Can set administratos and issuers for each class
			- Avoiding liquidity pools early on as it creates speculation
				- Not much known about the mechanism design
				- Osmosis wont work as theres a bootstrapping mechanism that requires selling back which wont work for credits that get retired
				- Price discovery through tagging
					- Monitoring report
					- Verified
					- TOKENSPACE ??
				- Peer review - building in public for community engagement
					- notion, discourse development of methodologies 
					- Source cred to measure contributions in the community
					- Foundation needs to avoid annurment (benefiting private entities like RND) - should be careful about methods that are owned and benefit the likes of RND

- Registry and foundation
	- DAO for developing methodologies
	- How do we have community self gov?
	- How do participants of a methodology design the incentive structure?
	- Whats our DAO pipelines
	- What are the DAO methodologies 

Users that could benefit from knowlege on the mechanisims 
- How do crypto mechanisms meet the real world?
