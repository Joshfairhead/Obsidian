Tica
- Works with the registry helping folks with projects to develop a methodology or in process. Working with scientists to get methodologies approved. Looking towards a project plan and issueing credits.
- Page to intro the registry and how to interact with us. Looking for feedback around coworking spaces and community growth. Combination of web2 and web3 governance mechanisms

Pranav:
- Catalyst 2030 - need to be a member to interact. Active in india, want to go from country of focus. 
- Entrapeneurs as a target category
- NGO space, land steward space.
- Degens who helped shape the space
- REFi south. Playing with multiple approaches; email course as top of the funnel to drive engagement. Going into specific communities, my climate journey, Terra.do, work on climate. Talk about refi in there
- Build in public and holding twitter spaces.
- Visualising a funnel, curious about refi form defi/impact spaces to understand climateXcrypto. Looking for projects that are looking for incubation of sorts and then connecting them up to regen and investors. 
- Gijs: meeting communities where they are at, building in public/holding spaces in public. Talk to an empty room even. 
- Funnel: wide space/newsletter > Mett the community > twitter spaces/personal audience

Tica:
- Where is the space for collaboration? Hylo? Needs to decied on platform they wish to use, try to seed and nurture.
- Tamara: Scattered and fragmented information. Information overload. Too many spaces in need of consolidation. Scrolling is a pain in the ass. Hard time finding the information shes after. Wrote in onboarding that she'd like to see an ecosystem map and how the information flows in order to filter information; it's a web I don't understand. 101 on regen ecosystem. 
- Tica: working on that for a registry intro. What is this; guide, ledger and application. Working on it the last couple of weeks. Put the piece out and got feedback about including a bunch of stuff. Needs a big picure overview
- Pranav: building on Tamara; look at it like the customer journey. Impact space, web2 space etc. will have specific requirements in the regen ecosystem and will need to know these as they get deeper. How quictly can w get people using the system. Frmo there discovery. Changes happen all the time; infinite loop of building all the time. MVP for onboarding form different perspectives
- Josh: user stories > user personas > user journey
- Gijs: would use what he knows. Ignore github. Found user forums helpful to search out questions, feels more confident asking questions when there are none alread asked. Adobe premier being an example
- Most questions asked in discord to get the user stories via the moderators
- Tamara: tech is a pain in the ass; forcing shared cals and such so folks get used to tools. Most of this is overwhelming. Basic platform. Having to learn multiple spaces and shif through jargon to get information. If it were just one space it would be handy.

Gijs:
- Slide deck
- Pranav: social proof and demand side, how much business have you already done - why should I trust you? Needs it early in the deck. Ask needs to be more focused and prioritised. 
- Tamara: defining an creditclass vs DAO. Describe the process with an info graphic
- Austin: what five terms are significant for this?
- Austin: opacity to find information; routing groups to the right points. Resources for user journey, taking care of people so they are not flung into noisy spaces. Conversation space vs resource space.
- Frame the communications: sync/async, learning/applying, long/short form.
