# Revathi 14-12-21

## Meeting Agenda
### Potential Synnergies
**Organisational**
- Process modelling; using Statebox to model and optimise internal processes with applied category theory.
- H3 University & Governance design; a wealth of experience building adaptive organisations through the implementation of anticipatory governance. This work ties into fractal organisation (circles) and intentional futures work to inform operations and strategy (viable systems).
- Open Team & 2030. I feel I still need more information on OpenTeams situation but from initial impressions it sounds like a service company I was helping to setup in 2018 might be the solution. The company was getting set up with the FCA (UK's SEC) to tokenise equity, especially for emerging ESG solutions. They take a small slice of the token allocation to nourish themselves for their work investment.

**Educational and community**
- Microsolidarity crew work; transforming a contineous flow of individuals into a contineous flow of small groups trough generative spaces. We've been working on a meta-framework based on Christopher Alexanders work on unfolding wholeness and optimising for "life" (aka maximising affordances). It would probably serve as a good blueprint for designing educational programmes and other spaces that allow for "other ways of knowing". 

**Ecosystem and outreach**
- Hackathons; Odyssey platform/alliences. 
- Strategic profile picture of myself "beating their drum" on foundation website?
	- Sovrign Nature Initiative hackathon runs on the Odyssey platform
		- Hackathon deadline on the 20th December.

## Call notes
- Educational programme headed by Gijs is on hold while dealing with the goverment takeover of Auroville. We can flesh this out while he's away but he's taking the lead on that. Making it loosely coupled and composible sounded like a hurdle. This brought me back to the Microsolidarity work mentioned above as it's been designed in such a manner. Further to this it sounded like it would probably find resonance with Austin due to his educational/archetectural background. The group has opted to introduce this work to others by offerering experential readings; I'm happy to foster exploration if anyone wishes to recieve the offer.

- Governance circle approved. This is a platform for which I've been given mandate to foster; it's exact form is unshaped as of yet and I'll be an initial steward of the circle. This means prefiguring the space and then integrating feedback. Revathi expressed a desire to take a consent based approach; recieving a proposal with initial outlines, plans and other bits of critical information before starting implementation. This should take variety into account and consider what agents want and how they fit. 

- Ledger Governance Coordination; this is about platform design. On reflection it seems that the above paragraph should be nested as a subsection of this role? Regardless, what I heard in our discussion was that the foundation needs a coummunity face fo the ledger/wallet to support community onboarding and help people understand the nuts and bolts of token delegation, validators and their role in the ecosystem as well as making potential power dynamics explicit and transparent. This is about stewarding the community campfire and helping non-technical members make sense of the world they are entering/involved with. 
	- Of particular interest is how the community integrates with the Regen Registry and the network health metrics.
		- Will is most involved with the treasury (delegation, management, validators). There are two wallets: 
			- EnDAOment (30m Tokens + staking rewards)
			- Validators (5m Tokens + staking rewards)
	- A desire to foster relationships between validators and the foundation was also expressed. 
	- Revathi expressed a desire to eventually transition the Regen Registry to a DAO which would then support the role via a communtity pool.
