"Wisdom Council"

Dear Regens, as a 'degen' in these lands I can only consider myself to be an epistemic tresspasser - which has been a pleasure but I don't wish to impose. I seek your guidance as to how this governance call can be handed off to the community with care; advice for an advice process I suppose. Can you help? 

For me it's imperative that we cultivate a viable and vital off chain governance process connected with the real world. However my personal skill set is probably best put to use driving technological evolution and economic activity at the ledger level. My intention as ledger governance coordinator is to become your digital intemediary between the ledger and land (assuming this assistance is welcomed). Can you help me make this transition? How can we double link the worlds of on and off chain? 

I humbly request your wisdom on these matters, please advise me :)

Warmest as always,
j
