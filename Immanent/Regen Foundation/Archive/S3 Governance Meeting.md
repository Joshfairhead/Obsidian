- Grattitude for the MMV (Marketing Meta View :p) - best high level vatage point so far!
- Agreements around 'the meta'; whos doing what at the 'epic level' (and why!)
	- What is driving us? e.g. is marketing driving operations or are operations driving marketing?
		- Theres probably syntropy between these elements - and probably other elements at play!
	- What constraints do we need to set on how and when things will be done?
