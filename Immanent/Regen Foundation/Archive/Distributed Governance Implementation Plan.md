## Adgenda 
- Grattitude for the MMV (Marketing Meta View :p) - best high level vatage point so far!
- Agreements around 'the meta'; whos doing what at the 'epic level' (and why!)
	- What is driving us? e.g. is marketing driving operations or are operations driving marketing?
		- Theres probably syntropy between these elements - and probably other elements at play!
	- What constraints do we need to set on how and when things will be done?
- [[Regen Network Map]]

### Intention
- Divergent segment: reflection on the big picture 
- Convergent segment: loose consensus on the domains projects fit into and the roles we play

### Engagement level
- Temprature check with the intention of arriving to a relaxed atmosphere and soft focus.

### Interaction patterns
- Variable. See: [[Game Shifting Elements]]
