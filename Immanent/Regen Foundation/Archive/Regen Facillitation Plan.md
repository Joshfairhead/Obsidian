# Regen Facillitation Plan

The meeting is scheduled as unstructured so as not to prefigure the space.

⚠️ Reading the content below WILL prefigure that space by priming your perceptual lenses. If you wish to arrive to the gathering with uncoloured perception, please read no further ⚠️

With that warning in place; its my opinion that well chosen structures can be liberating and enabling and in that spirit I have shaped the following workshop in preparation as a sacrificial offer (if there are any objections we can abandon ship or modify the content). I’ve done my best to contemplate the questions consciously with the hope that they will enable us to tap into our alive, vital and creative energies.

## Why?

To enhance our resolution and mental models of the network structure, our domains and roles across them.

## How?

A sequence of questions that are structured to deepen collective inquiry and clarity.

The sequence structure below starts with the individual (creative environment), moves to the collective (contextual environment) and then back a level of scale to circles/domains (transactional environment). This ordering is chosen to encourage a sense of embodiment and agency first, collective aspirations second and then finally some domain clarification to bridge the gap between them.

Each prompt should be considered individually for 2 minutes. The second step is to repeat this enquiry with a partner for 4 minutes in a breakout room. Thirdly we enquire as a group into what particularly stood out for another 4 minutes.

Each prompt is thus considered for at least 10 min. At the end of a 10 min round we can choose to repeat the round for further clarity or move on to the next prompt. At the end of the third prompt the excersise can be started over from the beginning for a sensed increased resolution.

### Prompts:

-   Roles orientation (1-2-All):
    -   Given your lived experience within the network so far; what kinds of personal contributions do you see as creative, meaningful and necessary?
    -   What about collective contributions?
-   Network structure (1-2-All):
    -   What do you perceive as the networks guiding 'north star'? If possible, try to describe the constellations of its highest aspirations.
-   Domains (1-2-All):
    -   Given the contributions articulated as either intrinsically or extrinsically meaningful and the articulations our 'north star' - what domains of activity are becoming clearer?

## What?

A strategic roadmap of our terrain and a shared perception of how it may unfold across time.
