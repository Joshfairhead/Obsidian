## Pause for quiet reflection
- Grounded in Horizon one what is present for you in your context? What are your constraints?
- Looking ahead to the aspirational future of Horizon 3, what do you hope to achieve?
- Bridging the gap between them at Horizon 2, what transformations are sufficient for now?
---
## Stepping back a moment - for whom? why?
- To grow capacity at scale WITH our community, synnergetic partners and network participants.
---
## High level view of the network
- The following image is just one perspective that necessarily omits detail - is it sufficient?

## Time permitting... some updates!

## Foundation Updates
Modeling the Organisation
-   Why, how, what, where, when?
-   Articulating domains of activity and making roles more explicit
-   Practicing and developing our theories of change
-   Constructing proposals for our governance processes
-   Operational processes starting to congeal (pipelines, task mgmt)
-   Marketing outreach and branding in the works (group identity)

## Ledger Updates
- Conversations around reducing the validator voting period from 14 days
- Community Grants pool
	- Soliciting ideas from the community regarding how to grant a pool of 2mm Regen
		- No [constraints on the proposals](https://forum.regen.network/t/community-grants/267/2) (yet); it’s a search for the [novel and unexpected](https://forum.regen.network/t/community-pool-grant-ideas/294)
- Staking Delegation Strategy (enDAOment funds)
	- In development; how should we redelegate the enDAOment pool that we currently steward?
	- Currently the enDAOment pool is delegated to earn staking rewards, this avoids dilution.
    - The enDAOment delegation is distributed across the ‘middle class’ of validators
		- Reduces resource accumulation in the top percentile
		- There is a 5% minimum commission to avoid a race to the bottom
	- What metrics should we consider to ensure just distribution?
		- Quantitative is easier to figure out but space is held for qualitative measures also!
		- Opportunities for engagement?
