## Pause for quiet reflection
- Grounded in Horizon one what is present for you in your context? What are your constraints?
- Looking ahead to the aspirational future of Horizon 3, what do you hope to achieve?
- Bridging the gap between them at Horizon 2, what transformations are sufficient for now?

## Input / Retrospective
- What do we need? What do we want
- 






## Time permitting... some updates!
---
## Foundation Updates
Modeling the Organisation
-   Why, how, what, where, when? - for whom
-   Articulating domains of activity and making roles more explicit
-   Practicing and developing our theories of change
-   Constructing proposals for our governance processes
-   Operational processes starting to congeal (pipelines, task mgmt)
-   Marketing outreach and branding in the works (group identity)

## Ledger Updates
- Conversations around reducing the validator voting period from 14 days
- Community Grants pool
	- Soliciting ideas from the community regarding how to grant a pool of 2mm Regen
		- No [constraints on the proposals](https://forum.regen.network/t/community-grants/267/2) (yet); it’s a search for the [novel and unexpected](https://forum.regen.network/t/community-pool-grant-ideas/294)
- Staking Delegation Strategy (enDAOment funds)
	- In development; how should we redelegate the enDAOment pool that we currently steward?
	- Currently the enDAOment pool is delegated to earn staking rewards, this avoids dilution.
    - The enDAOment delegation is distributed across the ‘middle class’ of validators
		- Reduces resource accumulation in the top percentile
		- There is a 5% minimum commission to avoid a race to the bottom
	- What metrics should we consider to ensure just distribution?
		- Quantitative is easier to figure out but space is held for qualitative measures also!
	- Opportunities for engagement?

-   42 Community Funding Program [recipients](https://twitter.com/regen_network/status/1485643469351632899)
-   Permissioned credit classes [proposal](https://github.com/regen-network/governance/tree/main/proposals/2021-12-regen-registry-credit-class-creator) pending on chain governance vote
-   Developing ‘bottom up’ practice based methodologies
-   External registry participation is often limited to an ‘elite class’ of institutionalised actors who have the resources for strict compliance to international standards
-   This rules out a lot of place based regenerative practitioners that we don’t want to exclude
-   The registry is figuring out how to open these doors to participation without diluting quality. 
-   Designing the registry protocols
-   Slowly decentralising the registries curation mechanics from the science team to the ledger
