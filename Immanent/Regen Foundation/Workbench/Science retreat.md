Gregory in the commonts:
So the basic question I’d love to hear opinions on are: do we have community governed curation tags?  Or force community governance over credit issuance itself?  OR BOTH?

And credit classes are the basic unit of curation in the current architecture.  So if there is a “holistic grazing” practice based credit, does that credit issued by anyone?  Currently the answer to that is NO, credit classes can only be governed by allow listed folks.  In the future as a community we can either maintain a governance gating around this, or open it up to be completely open, and rely simply on community governance of curation tags and community run auditing…
