So the basic question I’d love to hear opinions on are: do we have community governed curation tags?  Or force community governance over credit issuance itself?  OR BOTH?

And credit classes are the basic unit of curation in the current architecture.  So if there is a “holistic grazing” practice based credit, does that credit issued by anyone?  Currently the answer to that is NO, credit classes can only be governed by allow listed folks.  In the future as a community we can either maintain a governance gating around this, or open it up to be completely open, and rely simply on community governance of curation tags and community run auditing…

Gaining alignment about their work with our work

- RND hiring a grants manager for registry

- Fledgeling org starting their first pilot programe
- Work groups for carbon credit valorisation are probably the ground 
- Fitting together biochar and communities 
- Work group is a way to get people around the table 
- Anticipated oldschool so pitch was geared at that
- Seeing opportunity to remodel via the workgroup
- Vocabulary issues to bridge but howards happy to bridge to their board
- Model is intended to scale and why the work group is so important
- How do we engage? 
- Objectives (scoped to 1 and open to second. Seed and grow)
	- When biochar is producing - crediting the input
	- Wants their 'best in class' style methods to securitise these assets in the larger markets
- Constraints by use case
- Locally based best practice (not global best practice)
- Taking on board a much tighter definition of carbon product
- Using the registry and other methodolagy guidelines to build and develop a deeper methodology
- Internal work group are focused on the "how?" which informs methodology
- Second pilot in the year around agro forrestry
-
