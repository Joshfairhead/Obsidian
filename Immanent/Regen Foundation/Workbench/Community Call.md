### Driver
How do we support the plurality of community needs given our limited capacity? 

### Proposal title
Bi-weekly community support call on Wednesdays at 12:00 ET.

### Proposal body
Use the community call to act as a directory service for matching ecosystem participants to Regen representatives and domains of responsibilty. Each organisational domain (Foundation, Endaoment, Science team) would provide a representative acting as a "lead link" to hold 'office hours' in a breakout room during the community call. 

Participants showing up to the call can then jump in the appropriate break out room to interact with the representative they need to get feedback or help from. If there is a large degree of momentum behind a certain working group, then one of its represtentatives may act as a 'lead link' and reqest a 'backlink' from the appropriate domain to join their WG's efforts. This would be a regen team member who would sync back with the 'lead link' in order to tie back into the appropriate 'department' or 'circle'.


### Expected outcomes
- A space for ecosystem participants to gain limited interaction with domain specific representatives
- A space for ecosystem participants to request deeper interactions with network reps
- A space for ecosystem participants to interact with eachother
- A lightened load for teams managing multiple partnerships 
- Clear pathways to find/deepen support from the foundation and other domain representatives
