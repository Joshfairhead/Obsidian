At the Regen Foundation we've been discussing the nature of governance and how to ground our aspirations into embodied practice. Our kick of discussion centred around framework, power, praxis and social poetry. Here are some expressions we'd like to share:

1) Prompt determins the potential. Power is directly related to frame; a given prompt constrains or enlivens our possibility spaces. Questions, methodologies, metaphores, ledgers and languages are all frames. We are aware of this.
	- As we are human and error is a fact of life, we have a responsibility to make our implicit framing as transparent as possible so that others may hold us to account and push back if necessary. This form of dissent should be considered normal. 
		- Internally this means making the form of our meeting structures and interactions upfront and explicit. How do we do this? 
	- To bring a inclusive and regenerative future into existance we need to escape "the forbidden zone" of western thought. Other ways of knowing (or understanding) are often disregarded by such industrialised cultures. 
		- Epistemology is the science of knowing. What we consider "an appropriate frame" is tied to our epistemological assumptions. Do you think we are free? 
2) In a group setting such epistemological assumptions can be exclusionary. For example Western rationalism has often failed to value "other ways of knowing" and has consequentially devestated for indigeneous communities. 



## Language
- Metaphores we live by; how do our metaphores guide us?
- Language to scaffold how ideas can emerge; structural violence is embedded in language. Capitalism and war dwell within many of our metaphores; for instance spending / taking time (the ultimate currency, but framed capitalistically)
	- Win / loose a conversation frames it as a battle
	- Transactions; such as the idea of 'commerce'
- How do we make space for talking about markets and worlding in the space were occupying in relation to nature?
 - One of the core things the foundation is creating a shared lexicon that can encompass variety. This is an exploration af literacy. 
- 	Language space being academic and comfortable for native english speakers but not necessarily so for other cultures; spelling it out for others to get on the same page.
	- Minimal set of understandood terms as explicit; not taking this is for granted with others in our interface with the community. How do we reduce this gap?
- Language as spells. 
	- Cultures in time have put much more **emphasis on what is said and NOT said, especially in certain cantexts**. What is said can invoke distopias, or be used accidently to influence the course of events. 
	- Coming back to reverence with our words and their power 
- There is a tendancy that when you say things, there is an implication of provinence and ownership as a result. How we recraft ownership via language?
- Practices of language waiting to grow and emerge. We are in a fruitful space to do this in relation to the land and growing new forms of social poetry

### Language / Value
- On Language
	- Inherent value vs rationality
	- Rationality and rhetoric are about comparison (epistemology and how we know something)
		- Scientific rationality relies on research and citations
		- Money strips out the multi faceted dimensionality and reduces it to a snigle number for the sake of balance sheet comparisons. An example of reductive rationality.
		- "Why does this matter" = justification and inherent epistemology
	- Setting us back into a relationship with ourself and why they (justifications?) matter inherently
		- How do we value a tree for its treeness?
	- Epistemology of rationality and rhetoric distance us from our rdirect relationship with being thing relationship and place

### Structures
- Development psychology to inform structures
	- Robert Keegan 'level 5' requires entropy and unstructure
	- Level 4 is like a structured machine
	- Postulates level 4 and level 5 need integration as the transactional space
	- 4 structure is a nice fall back space that needs to accomidate level 5 emergenc
- Nice to visually represent Modes (facillitation vs non facillitator mode = Gameshifting)
- Self facillitation first, but seeing how conversations are defined by the structuring of framework. Being aware of whos structuring and scaffolding the space

### Semiotics and bio-semiotics 
- Communication and meaning making
- Thinking about the regeneration of living systems and what happens outside of language and words
- How we interact with non human entities
- Wordless poems to the other being 
	- Sharing poems was guessable by others even with out indication just by the shape of the sounds
	- Art as a language of gesture; play of light, shape of sounds - implicit communication that shows up in branding and the limited bandwidth of the written word

### Mnemonics and worlding
 - How can we keep a reverence for the mnemonic form that lives in place, culture, nature
 - How is the landscape conserved in mnemonics; song lines conserve this in interesting forms. There are potentially many other forms that this can take.
- Culturally important and held close to heart.
- Digital disparity; disruption of place
- Elders passing on stories in governace circles within some communities
- Elaborate cloths as communication encodings; ledgers that are passed on and creating historical record beyond words. Only certain people can encode and decode this information 

### Dimensionality and representation reduction
- Dimensional reduction seen alot between real life and the digital space, very alive for Revs
- Digital representation is always a reduction. See: [[Nooscope.ai]]
- In what ways are we producing insane dimensionality reduction and how do we get into a place thats mediates between our "rational" epistemology and 'non-rational' ways of knowing that practice humanhood
- How do we own up to our dimensionality reduction?
