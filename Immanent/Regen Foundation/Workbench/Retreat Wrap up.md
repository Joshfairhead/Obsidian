# Retreat Wrap up

Hi folks,

Thanks for your attendence at the team retreat. It was great to meet you all in person for the first time! If you had expenses such as PCR tests, filghts or Taxis, you can send them in to the foundation and we'll reimburse you. If you are a contractor / staff you can simply use the regular DEEL platform, if you are not then the points of contact to send reciepts in accounting are:
- Anastasios: ana.grigori@gmail.com
- Tiffany: tiffanycanaday@gmail.com

They also request you fill in the following form: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18YZ9TMLiSI5UbtzMNxBguhlmDmwAV9eB/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104916034209481578895&rtpof=true&sd=true

Having addressed expenses, it would be great to know from folks in attendence what worked and what did not work? Just mail me directly on this thread 

Once again, thank you for spending your most precious resource with us - your time!

Warmest,
josh
