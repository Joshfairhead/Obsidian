## Recap

- This information has been clustered and synthesised in Mural.

## Introduction
- Hi I'm Josh
- I'm the protocol governance coordinator at the Regen Foundation. My purpose here and mandate is to serve you, the Regen community. My agenda is to facillitate multi-scale nested governance through working groups and participatory sessions.

## Purpose
- Helping you to find the right people to interact with as a directory service
- Weaving a community tapestry for those that don't have a point of contact / domain of interest

---

## Agenda
- Team introductions / domain stewards
- Breakout rooms for face time w/stewards
- Participatory session for those unsure where they want to be / choose your own adventure

## Breakout rooms
