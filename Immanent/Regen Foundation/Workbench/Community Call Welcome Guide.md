# Community Call Welcome Guide

Hey! Welcome to the network :)

Group calls can be a little intimidating on your own so we suggest finding a buddy or crew to work with. The easiest way to do that is by making "a call for participation" or answering one at a community organised event. That can be done here at the community call, or at another event such as a twitter space, you can find out more a little further down but first - what is the community call?

The most definitive answer is that its an evolutionary vehicle in a permenent process of becoming... That is to say that we only know what it is in hindsight and its future is always speculative in nature. A better question is thus "what has the community call been so far?" - this we can help answer!

### The Story So Far
The community call started as a call to participation itself. We invited network participants to gather with us in order to coordinate the meeting of individual and collective needs. The first session outlined an abstract journey we were embarknig on and sought community feedback on our values, meaning and purpose through the three horizons methodology.

We took the feedback and integrated it into a second session which introduced the idea of office hours; calls to participation in the registry and endaoment programmes. These were held in breakout rooms. 

The third session was about shared connection; a pollination session around the notion of governance and what a distributed governance implementation plan should represent. The general conclusions were that it's social fabric, education and decision making. 

The fourth session addressed social fabrics at different levels of scale via a segmentation analysis, followed by an offers and needs market. Participants introduced themselves and located themselves within an embedded ecology of individuals, guilds, organisations, ecosystems and value chains. Offers/requests were then made at these various levels so that community members could sync with eachother.

The fifth session was a call for wisdom and community activation. In all honesty the session was a little fragmented but numerous calls for participation and proposals were made. Those making calls for participation were invited to hold sensemaking sessions in various Twitter spaces. 

The sixth session was centered around healing; what does the call want to become? what spaces are needed to expand the calls capacity in answer to community needs? Who wants to participate in these calls? These were enumerated via a digital white board. Calls for a facillitation guild were made by the community. 

The next sessions are currently under development as we integrate feedback and iterate. 

### Next Chapters

With this background established we can ask what's the call becoming? The content of all these calls has been centered around registry grants, endaoment and proposals/resourcinng from the community pool. The communtiy call has so far been building off chain essence; elders and fellows showing up to meet eachother and articulate hopes, dreams and desires. If we want to know what its becoming, let's look to the ledger; what would this look if we onboard the ledger to these constituents?

Spaking speculativly, it would most likely take the form of an allocation committee and facillitation guild helping to steward the Regen Network as a whole. Perhaps this is becoming a product circle? We have both internal and external participants from the ledger, marketing, foundation ops, endaoment and the registry. This is perhaps the product circle?

### How to onboard?

The easiest way to onboard is to just turn up at a session and connect with others, but lets get a little more pragmatic; where are the touch points to deepen engagement from there? Choose your own adventure by engaging with working groups. Which ones? How do I find them you ask? You'll need to listen out for opportunity or be proactive but this is the general process outlining where you can find points of engagement:

### Proposal flow:

-   A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
-   A date and location for public sense making is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
-   A sense making session then occurs publicaly via community platform with a foundation representation present (e.g. Discord or Twitter Space)
-   Parties that find synnergy and wish to continue worknig together start a proposal discussion on common wealth; optionally creating a presentation to share on a public platform (e.g. Community call)
-   This off chain presentation serves to drive proposal discussion on the commonwealth forum before the calling party deems that sufficient discussion has occured in order to finalise a proposal
-   The proposal is then polished with foundation representative sign off and then put to an on chain vote; should mention various criterea (team, resources, capabilities, talents etc.)
-   Proposal passes or fails based on validator discresion

The question then becomes "how do I make a call for participation?"; that much is easy - just do it wherever makes sense to you. If you wish for more support we have a number of spaces where we deliberatly ask if anyone wishes to make such a call:

- Community Call (most sessions)
- Twitter spaces
- Office Hours
- Social coding
