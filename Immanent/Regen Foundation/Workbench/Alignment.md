# Alignment

This note seeks to integrate the various moving pieces in the Regen ecosystem pertaining to Foundation activities. It's not complete but paints a picture of what might be for the benefit of Will and Austin. It includes discussion from the alignment session with Revs and Gijs.

Starting at the top we have a ET community call from which we can imagine a speculative future. This 'proposal' is offered in the spirit of feedforward. 

The first thing to think about in that regard is the release of Ledger 4.0 which includes the groups module. Its currently being audited and MAY be ready in about two weeks time based on estimates I've recieved from Ryan. This is not certain but offers a starting point.

Austin suggested an inclination towards enDAOing participants from this call during the last session but its perhaps worth generalising towards the larger Regen community. The commission generated by this DAO can reward participants from the ET and IST for their service and attention. I'd call it a community service centre or similar. 

This csDAO would perhaps be a multi-sig, with Ledger 4.0 bringing the groups module and authz feature online we could onboard both groups into seperate DAOs and use authz to sign the multi-sigs wallet transactions (e.g. allocate and approve spends).

Sending small alloctaions to individuals shouldn't be a regulatory issue but larger csDAOs would face such uncertainties.
