# Community Campfire Invitation

Hey folks,

This is an update on the Community Call so that you have the necessary context to discern if its for you or not - right now "what it is" is still a little nacent and this post is intended to propose and clarify some things .

### Quickstart
Regular cadence: 
- Six week macro cycles divided in three parts following a cyclical pattern.
- Bi-weekly calls on Wednesday 17:00GMT.
- Diffeerent session emphasis every two weeks until the cycle completes and repeats. 

Cyclical Pattern:
- Aspect 1: Strategy
- Aspect 2: Resourcing and potentials
- Aspect 3: Culture

### Readme
Being our first cycle we are currently bootstrapping the following pattern:
- Our first session was focused on elucidating a high level strategy through a three horizons session.
- Our second session was focused on resourcing via enDAOment
- Our third session will be focused on bootstrapping cultural practices and frames

During the Campfire the three pathways of strategy, resourcing and culture will be available as breakout rooms. These rooms will run initial sessions to get things started but as the community steps into their agency stewards will become more hands off and the rooms will become more functional interfaces to the organisation. 

Its expected that the community will tread their own paths that run on a variety of cadences both online and offline. Same for domains within the organisation such as EnDAOment. Therefore having a regular cadence of strategy, potentiality/resources and culture can act as a touch point for the 'lead links' of these groups to report progress and updates every six weeks.
