# Processes

Integrated Proposal process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for public sense making is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- Sense making session then occurs via community platform with Foundation representation (e.g. Discord or Twitter Space)
- Parties that find synnergy and wish to continue then start a proposal discussion on common wealth; and optionally create a presentation to share it on a public platform
- Off chain presentation serves to drive proposal discussion on the commonwealth forum before calling party decides sufficient discussion for a vote
- Proposal is then put to the on chain vote
- Proposal passes or fails
