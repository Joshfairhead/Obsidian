# Processes

## Integrated Proposal Process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for public sense making is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- A sense making session then occurs publicaly via community platform with a foundation representation present (e.g. Discord or Twitter Space)
- Parties that find synnergy and wish to continue worknig together start a proposal discussion on common wealth; optionally creating a presentation to share on a public platform (e.g. Community call)
- This off chain presentation serves to drive proposal discussion on the commonwealth forum before the calling party deems that sufficient discussion has occured in order to finalise a proposal
- The proposal is then polished with foundation representative sign off and then put to an on chain vote; should mention various criterea (team, resources, capabilities, talents etc.)
- Proposal passes or fails based on validator discresion

Note: it makes sense to start measuring engagement rate and turn out on commonwealth. When proposal discussion length participation was higher. Current measure post shortening the window is 63%~ 

## Integrated enDAOment Process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for the lab is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- A labs session occurs on zoom and is recorded (put on youtube) by foundation representative
- During the lab parties find synnergy and continue working together. 
- As labs mature into relationships enDAOment candidates are nominated by foundation representatives based on established criterea (just distributions).
- Nominees are socialised with the existing community via a pollination event and relationships form. 
- Once these relationships are mature EnDAOment candidates are selected

Note: it makes sense to nominate capacity builders/stewards early in this process as they will act as amplifiers.
