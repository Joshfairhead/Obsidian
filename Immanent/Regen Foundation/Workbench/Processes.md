# Processes
We are seeking to optimise a [[Gini coefficient]]

## Proposal Process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for public sense making is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- A sense making session then occurs publicaly via community platform with a foundation representation present (e.g. Discord or Twitter Space)
- Parties that find synnergy and wish to continue worknig together start a proposal discussion on common wealth; optionally creating a presentation to share on a public platform (e.g. Community call)
- This off chain presentation serves to drive proposal discussion on the commonwealth forum before the calling party deems that sufficient discussion has occured in order to finalise a proposal
- The proposal is then polished with foundation representative sign off and then put to an on chain vote; should mention various criterea (team, resources, capabilities, talents etc.)
- Proposal passes or fails based on validator discresion

Note: it makes sense to measure discussion time and voting turn out on commonwealth. Before proposal discussion length shortened participation was higher. Current measure is  63%~ 

## EnDAOment Process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for the lab is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- A labs session occurs on zoom and is recorded (put on youtube) by foundation representative
- During the lab parties find synnergy and continue working together. 
- As labs mature into relationships enDAOment candidates are nominated by foundation representatives based on established criterea (just distributions).
- Nominees are socialised with the existing community via a pollination event and relationships form. 
- Once these relationships are mature EnDAOment candidates are selected

Note: it makes sense to nominate capacity builders/stewards early in this process as they will act as amplifiers. It also seems reasonable to record the number of candidates selected and check it matches our distribution criterea. It seems prudent to measure funds distributed

## Hiring Process
- A call for new hires is put out articulating foundation needs/wants
- Candidates contact the foundation (with/without information) and a date/time/location for further interaction is set.
- "coffee chat" and sense mak

## Onboarding Process
- A desire to participate in emitted on a community platform or other channels
- Community member is connected with a point of contact in the ecosysetem
- An orientation process occurs through socialisation in a public space (office hours, community campfire)
- During this orientation the new participant meets others working on projects
- The new participant finds a project to work on
- When work is near completion they socialise it with other teams
- Work is finalised
- New member is onboarded

Note: measures should include community members that initiate onboarding, the number of finalised artefacts and the drop off rate.


## Advice Process
## Partnership Process (Consortium Building)
