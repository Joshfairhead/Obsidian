# Processes

Integrated Proposal process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for public sense making is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- A sense making session then occurs via community platform with Foundation representation present (e.g. Discord or Twitter Space)
- Parties that find synnergy and wish to continue then start a proposal discussion on common wealth; and optionally create a presentation to share it on a public platform
- Off chain presentation serves to drive proposal discussion on the commonwealth forum before calling party deem there has been sufficient discussion to finalise a proposal
- Proposal is polished with foundation representative and then put to an on chain vote
- Proposal passes or fails based on validator discresion
