- Public sense making session then occurs via community platform (e.g. Discord or Twitter Space)
- Interested parties that find connection should start a proposal discussion and optionally create a presentation
- The off chain presentation serves to drive discussion on the commonwealth forum 
- Proposal is then put to the on chain vote
