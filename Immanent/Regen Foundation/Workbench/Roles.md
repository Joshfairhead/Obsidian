Austin:
As part of each enDAOment sprint each new community needs to set up a pristine wallet for the locked token transfer. This educational supportÂ  and communication , including how setup, delegatation and voting seems to me to fall within governance coordinator position as it is the essential capacities necessary for formal governance participation
