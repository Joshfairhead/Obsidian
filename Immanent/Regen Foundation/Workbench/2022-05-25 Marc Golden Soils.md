# 2022-05-25 Marc Golden Soils

Based in Germany between the wall where nuclear waste was dumped. 47 years of protest about it against the state, police, trains bringing waste. The areas turned inte a progressive green partry organic zone. 

Porducers are buying certificates from around the world and would like to buy credit certificates from their own region. 

Would like to work with Academics and experts to apply remote sensing by Circana. Would be ideal for the registry. Marc does the field work gathering farmers and doing the data collection; supported via tthes staking DAO rewards. 

Questions:
- Would csDAOs be non-profit or NGOs and what would it look like?
- How does it work with Juristiction and Taxes?
- Can it be a start up?
- Do you know Alan? Hes in Portugal worknig on Mangroves! 

Vera no till soil methodology. Simple result based no till cover crops that works with remote sensing that can be adjusted based on the software model that Circana comes up with during the trials.

Next steps would be cobenefits of biodiversity.

Circana are not using proxys, they directly measure carbon as a facinating shortcut
