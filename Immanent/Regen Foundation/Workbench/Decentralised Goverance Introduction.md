# Decentralised Goverance Introduction
Before we dive into the registry itself let's look at fundementals it's built upon and the governance structures it inherits as a result:

On the Regen blockchain 30% of the token supply was withheld for delegation to underrepresented communities, these are given away or 'enDAOed' by the Regen foundation. Functionally this means that some of the largest token holders in the network are entities referred to as csDAOs, whom the blockchain validators seek the approval of when considering community spend proposals or paramater changes to the network. This consensus mechanism is known as 'delegated proof of stake'.

Advantages to bulinding on this form of technology enables a number of adaptive advantages to other more traditional registry programmes:
- Open participation and inclusivity
- Transparency
- Scalability
