# Regenerative Governance and the Creative Commons

There's an abundence of commons literatue but one title in particular called Fair, Free, Alive stands out to me. I feel that this triple adequitly describes the internal significance or content of 'the commons' pretty sufficiently, but the external context that enabled by such activity remains perhaps warrents discussin. I'm going to suggest that we investigate the overlapping terms of alive, vital, creative.

Here's a diagram I made integrating the terms for illiustrive purposes (add pentad image):
- Creative
- Free
- Alive
- Fair
- Vital

There are many commons already in existence; some are doing well but others more poorly. Open source software is fertile ground for researching case studies and all too often you hear of Hardins 'tragedy of the commons'; solo maintainers pouring their heart and soul into software thats appropriated by big tech without any form of reciprocal contribution. These stewards are often intimatly familliar with burn out but there are also  many thriving and creative commons in existence!

If we are investigating the practice of commoning lets start from the ground of a non-existant or depleted commons; how do we regenerate and enliven it? Let's look at the two extende terms we're adding to Bollingers triple - vital and creative. If our maintainer is not having their vital needs met their creative potential is severly limited. For now, let's ask what's vital mean?

My suggestion is that it represents a very germinal nature. For humans it's nutritious food, water, warmth, shelter and excercise; the things needed for our bodies to function well. It's pretty clear these needs apply to most citizens of the world and parallels for other forms of biological life. Without these matters of subsistence taken care of it's doubtful that a commons can be particularly creative or generative. From the lens of Ostroms terminology we are talking about the appropriation of resources. 

This in particular makes Open Source software distinct from a physical commons as the resource from which to appropriate is non-scarce and location independent. Sure, you can't monetise the resource directly because it's freely available but if you're creative there's an abundance of indirect opportunity available; resource appropriators just need make a market. For Open Source this is white label customisation, consulting, support, events and other ecosystem services; in blockchain there are even more granular niches to occupy and monetise. As mentioned this appropration is a necessary function; if the fisherman in Aryana cannot eek out a living from their allotment then there is very little point in participation and this is the same for open source ecosystems; itches need scratching at both individual and collective levels. This is vital and necessary.

With appropriation covered we can examine fairness. One frame for this might be the equitible distribution of resource appropriation; be it nutrients, commodities or finances. In relation the commons this is best considered access rather than ownership; how is access distributed and why? In a fishery, some spots will be better than others. In companies or open software development some participants have special privilages; merging code and so on. These privilages may or may not be fair so the parameters upon which they are decided and how they are renegotioted must be illuminated. These are governance questions and vary from case to case depending on the organisation or network.

Alive has its own shades. Its existential nature depends on vital resourcing, fairness and equity as mentioned but what of its essential nature? This is the relationship to freeness, freedom and creativity. The spillways.

The essential nature of a commons is to provision and resource; no resource pool, no commons. This is the waters of a fishery, an open source codebase or a blockchain. It's interesting to note that unlike open source software, blockchains abstract their resource pool from codebase to a currency. This focuses activities by constraining appropritation activity into a shared set of transparent parameters, which can in turn be renegotiated via a set of governance mechanisms. What should a crypto commons focus on though? 

Freedom perhaps? Thats what Bollingers triad points to. You can look at freedom as the removal of constraints; depending where your embedded in the system this can look like free range farms or permissionless open source software that's given away to the world as a gift. Abstracting free software to a free currency one must ask what kind of values should be embedded? Knowing up front is goind to be difficult so on a blockchain the freedom to negotiate new paramaters is essential as it enables the evolutionary adaptive capactities necessary for network survival.

In a world where complexity is rising we should aim to amplify creative capacity by increasing freedom. You might think of creativity as a process of assembling new wholes through workflows that meet the environment. This is the action of filling an ecosystem niche in generative ways. Distributed manufacturing and value chains are examples but creativity is simply the process of bringing something into existence; be it through methods or artefacts. 




What methods or artefacts are we then looking towards?
