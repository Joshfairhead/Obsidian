# Foundational Session EnDAOment

First things to tackle:
- EnDAOment and DAOs section of mural
	- Criterea for maximising the impact seems important
	- Day in the life of a DAO feels relevant and important
		- Much of the work seems hypothetical right now
		- Proposals are too low level for community relevance
		- Go through the process ourselves of getting a credit class issued and pilot the process
		- Creating a context (latching structures)
		- Going to take a lot of hand holding through the process to get this moving
	- Asking people to get involved with data/documentations is very abstract can be alien
	- How we are getting involved with DAOs has the assumption that they produce data and we are an omnicient onlooker; this may not be the case. Participatory action research?
	- What are the input/output flows from DAOs to the ecosystem/foundation/registry?
	- Expecting location specific DAOs to participate in our learning, turning churning on things tested in field
	- Curating facillitating amplifying methods and practices 
	- Expected time; who gets priority on staff time - recipricol
	- Bioregional coming back into our inquiry at a structural level
- Going back to why the foundation exists; cosmos SDK validators are often steering. Foundation and EnDAOment are 1/3rd of the votes; breaking the pattern of plutocracy.
	- Radically different from what land based communities are actually doing. "The contridiction that keeps me up at night"
- Can learn a lot from "Advocacy"
	- Why go travel/sit about a policy? Why get involved this way
	- Has to work with relationships; trusted agent with affective trust feeding back what they are hearing. Trust delegations
- Domains, **projects**, roles
- How do we build relationships in a way that can run itself; bus quotient. How do we scale without having to lubricate the web (its not a machine!)?
