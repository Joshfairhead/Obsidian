# Distributed Governance Implementation Plan

Wow, there are a whole lot of ways this one could go! This was the paradox I was charged with when hired for my position at Regen Foundation as Ledger Governance Coordinator. So what's do these terms represent? 

Take a deep breath, we're working in an industry thats never existed before so we're writing the narrative on the fly. It's the only way to do it!

## What?
Lets get into it; what's this plan? Well, for the plan to be distributed it means that it's authorship need be distributed and that the participants must write it. 

How does the community do that given it's alive and poly-centric? The plans changing immanently as we are just another part of the living world; a realm thats communicating rapidly all the time; every one of us emits a million biophotons a second with the strength of a candle light two miles in the distance and the intensity of a lazerbeam ~**Cosmic serpent**. 

So given that the network is a complex adaptive system thats always changing then any plan is simply a speculation on the future based on an uncertain snapshot thats riddled with immediacy bias... thats not going to work! 

Let's update our thinking; what we really need is a process or method that acts as a foundation and creates a stable baseline. What's that look like? We need a keystone methodology that is global in scope but can be applied to specific instances and scenarios; without this we have no baseline - just an arbitrary selection of methods that may or may not work in a given context. We need to think metaphysically.

So the plans actually a metaphysical process? It really has to be if we're to integrate all voices and stakeholders. Since this process is already alive and happening in real time we must to look back to priors to infer pathways forward. 

Instantiated specifically, we are already using methods and processes but are these schemas of the world fitting? Deductive logic cannot work as its complicated and we're working with adaptive complexity. Inductive logics such as systems thinking is better but lacks structure, sequence and clear direction. We need to combine the two in order to leverage abductive logic as it's the only form of reasoning that can help us in our herculean task.

## How?
Pragmatically though, let get into the weeds and endevour to continue the thought experiment in a practical context. How do we to get to our desired end state of planetary regeneration? Let's look at the Regen Ecosystem and try to figure out what the exactly is happening in order to chart our path forward. 

To start the process of planetary regeneration you need a vehicle of sorts; perhaps a digital republic? Starting at ground zero; viability depends on a sufficient variety of participants for something to catalyse. 

In Regens case the initial catalist was the emergence of RND; the networks progenitors. Essentially, they worked for Cosmos as a development shop which brought in and sustianed the resources needed to build the Regen ledger.

For this ledger to exist though; an ecosystem of participants running nodes must also be gathered requiring further communications and outreach. With this validator network in place data integrity is ensured through the blockchain but thats about all. Who are the validators in the set? What are their ethics and commitments? Whats their purpose here and hope to gain? For whom?

To ensure the vision stays on course it's necessary to make contingency plans against economic pressures by curating this ecosystem participation while passing over vision stewardship to a non-profit. In Regens case the foundation stewards 30% of the ledgers tokens in order to grow the capabilities and capacity towards impact by distributing them in a just manner. Whats justice then? and how does this apply to token distribution?

Starting with the former we know that social systems are long tail distributions. The social distribution of justice will have a short head and long tail; roughly a 70/30 split. 

Excellent, let's circle back to the notion of justice; whats this? If you trust Plato justice can be thought of as the distribution of privilage to inequity. Outliers on this spectrum in particular could use a hand up in the world as it's extreamly demanding to hang onto the long tail as extractive market mechanisms and structural violence takes you for a ride. 

So thats a just distribution covered; we know that the long tail is where the majority of our resources should go in order for it to be equitable. But an apparent paradox begins to present itself when considering impact and network growth over time. As you'll hear from MacKenzie Scott and other Philantropists; diricting funds towards impact means making extreamly difficult decisions under uncertainty. Should we prioritise the short head or the long tail? 

When thinking about non-living things like toaster sales the correct answer is to invest energy in the short head. However, humans are not toasters; toasters are complicated and fragile while humans are complex adaptive living beings. We are the most advanced technology nature has ever produced (or third most advanced if you ask Arthur C. Clarke); the principle of hormeisis applies and in evoloutionary theory adversity breeds resiliance. So where do we see the most adversity - the long tail or the short head? It's becoming increasingly clear that favouring the disadvantaged is not only the just and ethical thing to do but also the pragmatic pathway forward to building a more resiliant, regenerative and anti-fragile world! 

Great, that's the static conceptual framework sorted out, but pragmatically there are other considerations like the time dimension. How should we prioritise our efforts over time in order to be both efficient and effective? Here we need to think about variety matching annd interfacing between agents with our concerns directed towards shared capabilities and capacities. 

Capabilities are the skills necessary for agents to interact such as language, technical proficiency, knowlege, legal status and other dynamic properties. Capacities are then the degree to which an agent is skilled in a given capability - these can be gradiated or binary.

What capabilities and capacities are necessary and sufficient though? Pragmatically speaking this depends and changes based on a moving context; one set of capabilities this moment, others with a different degree of intensity the next. Internal resourcing and resourcefulness has a lot to do with it. Whats baseline? What are the networks imperatives? We are giving out resources but for what purposes?

Systemic pressures and imperatives will require our just distribution to be strategic.
While the network aims to regenerate planetary health it can't do so without subsistence; in that respect distributed ledger techology is quite alive. 

Ledgers need 'food' in the form of utility such as apps that create transaction velocity; art, NFTs and EcoCredits and so forth. Following on from these needs is 'security' in the form of network effects and mass adoption. Finally they need 'socialisation' in the form of community currencies and mutual credit to create positive sum dynamics between participants.

This means that in directing our efforts we need to consider people, planet and protocol at the macro level by harnessing markets, science, and technology. There is a reciprocol nature and pattern integrity between these components. At different moments in the networks evoloutiton our priorities need to shift from short term subsistance needs to longer term social impact. This has implications for the prioritisation of our distribution efforts. 

In this early stage of network growth we need to ensure network subsistance while looking ahead to future security and vitality. In that regard there are three peels
