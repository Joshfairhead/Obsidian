# Distributed Governance Implementation Plan

The first double bind I was tasked with when hired for my position at Regen Foundation was a distributed governance implementation plan. The title of Ledger Governance Coordinator also being a double bind and so can only exist in the world of forms and ideas! So what do these words represent and how do we create them?

Take a deep breath; we're working in an industry thats never existed before so action must in large doses be about imagination and creativity; it's the only way to create the future we wish to see. 

> Life's what happens when your busy making other plans ~John Lennon

## What?
Lets get into it; what's the ask here? For the plan to be distributed it means that it's authorship need be distributed and the participants must necessarily write it. How does the community do that given it's alive and poly-centric? 

The networks communication is immanently changing as the participants constantly adapt to the living world; a realm thats communicating rapidly all the time. Vaues and information are everywhere so how do you find significance in the noise? Did you know that every one of us emits a million biophotons a second with the perceptivity of a candle light two miles in the distance but with the intensity of a lazerbeam? ~**Cosmic Serpent** (fact check the data is correct). 

Given that we know the network is a complex adaptive system then any plan or cannoical source of truth is a necessary myth; a speculation on the future which eventually brings itself into existence. Any attempt at such a plan can only be a representitive snapshot riddled with immediacy bias. Let's abandon the plan and update our thinking.

What's really at play is a process and so to work with it we must call upon a method a consistent method can act as a stable baseline or measure. What's that look like though? We need a keystone methodology that is global in scope but can be applied to specific instances and scenarios; without such a method we have no baseline - just an arbitrary selection of ad hoc methods that may or may not work in a given context. Is there such an abstraction layer? Phew that's tough to answer but we need one if we are to integrate all voices and stakeholders. This all points to a real time process. Action learning. 

If we are simply copying what has been it will will continue indefinitly. If we want or need something new, how do we do create that? Again we're back to process and methodology; deductive logic cannot work as its complicated and we're working with adaptive complexity. Inductive logics such as 'systems thinking' are better but lack dicipline in their structure and sequence so theres often no clear direction but statistically speaking a false map is better than no map [cite source] . In order to succeed with our herculean task of planetary regeneration; we must integrate both forms of reason to leverage abductive logic. 

## How?
Pragmatically though, let get into the weeds and endevour to continue the thought experiment in a practical context. How do we to get to our desired end state of planetary regeneration? Let's look at our priors in the Regen Ecosystem and try to figure out what has happened so that we may better infer pathways forward. 

To start the process of planetary regeneration you need a vehicle of sorts; a soverign entity or perhaps republic? Starting at ground zero; viability depends on a sufficient variety of participants for something to catalyse. 

In Regens case an initial catalist might be considered the emergence of RND; the networks progenitors (though no doubt sowething came before). Essentially, RND came into being by working for Cosmos as a development shop; this brought in and sustianed the resources needed to build the Regen ledger.

For this ledger to exist though; an ecosystem of participants running nodes must also be gathered requiring further communications and outreach. With this validator network in place, data integrity is ensured through the blockchain but thats all. Here you wust ask who are the validators in the set? What are their ethics and commitments? Gladly, those I've met all seem of good character and principal.  

To ensure the vision stays on course it's necessary to make contingency plans against economic pressures by continuing to curate this ecosystem while passing over vision stewardship to a non-profit. In Regens case the foundation stewards 30% of the ledgers tokens in order to grow the capabilities and capacity towards impact by distributing them in a just manner. Whats justice then? and how does this apply to token distribution?

Starting with the former we know that social systems are long tail distributions. The social distribution of justice will consequentially have a short head and long tail; roughly a 70/30 distribution. 

Excellent, let's circle back to the notion of justice; whats this? If you trust Plato justice can be interpreted to be the distribution of privilage to inequity. Outliers on the inequity end in particular could use a hand up in the world as it's extreamly demanding work to hang onto the long tail; extractive market mechanisms and structural violence inflicts a lot of damage here.

So thats a just distribution covered; we know that the long tail is where the majority of our resources should go in order for it to be equitable. But an apparent paradox begins to present itself when considering network growth over time. As you'll hear from MacKenzie Scott and other Philantropists; diricting funds towards impact means making extreamly difficult decisions under uncertainty. Should we prioritise the short head or the long tail? 

When thinking about non-living things like toaster sales the correct answer is to invest your resources in the short head. However, humans are not toasters; toasters are complicated and fragile while humans are complex adaptive living beings and this needs o be taken into account. We are the most advanced technology nature has ever produced (or third most advanced if you ask Arthur C. Clarke). 

The general principle of hormeisis applies; adversity under the right conditions breeds resiliance and flow. So where do we see the most adversity - the long tail or the short head? It's now clear that favouring the disadvantaged is not only the just and ethical thing to do but also the pragmatic pathway forward to building a more resiliant and regenerative world! 

Ok, that's the basic conceptual framework sorted out but there are other considerations to be figured out such as network priorities over time. Here we need to start thinking about variety matching; interaction and interfacing between agents. How do we match capabilities and capacities?

Capabilities are skills such as language, technical proficiency, knowlege, legal status and other dynamic properties. Capacities are then the degree to which an agent is skilled in a given capability which can be gradiated or binary. Grounding things to our current context; basic English is probably enough to interface with our team but legal status is a binary necessity for enDAOment. Can we scope the binaries? What's necessary and whats sufficient? What about candidate qualities or their properties? This is a more instrumental consideration but such pragmatics must be considered if we are to succeed in our task.  

Pragmatically speaking qualitive prioritisation depends on a constantly shifting context in both organism/organisation and environment; one set of capabilities this moment, others with a different degree of intensity the next. Internal resourcing and resourcefulness will have a lot to do with meeting this outer world. 

Do we have sufficient internal variety as an organisation to cross all terrains and meet all agents? What are the imperatives at the network level that we must account for in our decision process? Other than a just distribution what are the practical constraints and pathways forward? Systemic pressures will require our distribution to be strategic in this way as to be of service the network must subsist.

In that respect ledgers are quite alive; they need 'food' in the form of utility such as apps that create transaction velocity; art, NFTs and EcoCredits and so forth. Following on from these needs is 'security' in the form of network effects and mass adoption. Finally they need 'socialisation' in the form of community currencies and mutual credit to create positive sum dynamics between participants and beyond. Where do we direct our attention at a given moment?

 Well as mentioned it seems our efforts must be threefold (utility, security, social) and change in an adaptive dynamic manner. Currently in Regens evolution the network pressures are probably around utility - though the seeds of mass adoption and multi-valent social currencies are priorities that must be seeded. 

This is where resourcing comes in. We have a community pool, enDAOment allotments and a nacent venture fund. One might consider the community pool resources for generating economic utility, the enDAOment pool to build network security through large scale participation and the nacent venture fund for social impact endevours. What does this look like over time? 

As far as the networks priorities go we need to compell digital activity first; generate longer term security second and incubate social endevours last. This is paradoxically backwards from our real priorities of social justice; will this breed inequity? My thinking is so which is why I've spent the majority of my time on working off chain goverance first. We need an auton reciptical of 

The three threads thus need to be ran concurrently even if there is a an uneven distribution of capacity between the technical and non technical.

Integrating the "what", "how" and "why" we get a pretty concise mission statement:

> The Regen protocol serves people and planet by harnessing markets, science and technology. 

Do you notice a reciprocol nature and pattern integrity coalescing these components?
