# Distributed Governance Implementation Plan

Wow, there are a whole lot of ways this one could go! This was the paradox I was charged with when hired for my position at Regen Foundation as Ledger Governance Coordinator. So what's do these terms represent? 

Take a deep breath, we're working in an industry thats never existed before so we're writing the narrative on the fly. It's the only way to do it!

## What?
Lets get into it; what's this plan? Well, for the plan to be distributed it means that it's authorship need be distributed and that the participants must write it. 

How does the community do that given it's alive and poly-centric? The plans changing immanently as we are just another part of the living world; a realm thats communicating rapidly all the time; every one of us emits a million biophotons a second with the strength of a candle light two miles in the distance and the intensity of a lazerbeam ~**Cosmic serpent**. 

So given that the network is a complex adaptive system thats always changing then any plan is simply a speculation on the future based on an uncertain snapshot thats riddled with immediacy bias... thats not going to work! 

Let's update our thinking; what we really need is a process or method that acts as a foundation and creates a stable baseline. What's that look like? We need a keystone methodology that is global in scope but can be applied to specific instances and scenarios; without this we have no baseline - just an arbitrary selection of methods that may or may not work in a given context. 

So the plans actually a process - what  look like? Well this again I don't know because its happening in real time and being only a part unable to see the macroscopic whole I'm blind. Even if I could examine whole with such a gods ee view; the living world is complex, emergent and even chaotic so I doubt it would make sense. There are infinite unknowns here so we're dealing with uncertainty, and due to this hazard agency can exist.

## How?
Pragmatically though, let endevour to continue the thought experiment and try to invisage how we to get to our desired end state of planetary regeneration. Thats our mission after all so let's look at the Regen Ecosystem and try to figure it out. 

For such an undertaking you need viability; this is the point where you must gather sufficient variety for something to come into being. In Regens case this probably coalesced in RND; they worked for Cosmos bringing in capital while building the Regen ledger in parallel.

For this distributed ledger to exist; a community of participants running nodes must be gathered and this requires communications and outreach. With a validator network running you are assured of data integrity but thats all.

To ensure vision integrity, it's necessary to make contingency plans against economic pressures by passing over vision stewardship to a non-profit. In Regens case the foundation stewards 30% of the ledgers tokens in order to grow capabilities and capacity; distributing them in a just manner. 

So whats a just distribution? Whats justice? Crikey these are big ones. 

Starting with the former we know that social systems are long tail distributions. The distribution of social justice will then have a short head and a long tail; roughly a 70/30 split. 

Excellent, let's circle back to the notion of justice which if you trust Plato can be thought of as a distribution of privilage to inequity. Outliers on this spectrum in particular could use a hand up in the world as it can be pretty rough hanging onto the tail. 

The paradox comes in thinking about impact; where should we place our efforts? In the long tail or the short head? Most commonly when thinking about non-living things like toaster sales the correct answer is the short head. HOWEVER we are not toasters; toasters are complicated and fragile. Instead we are complex adaptive systems to which the principle of hormeisis applies. In evolution adversity breeds resiliance so ask yourself where you find the most adversity; the long tail or the short head? 

Looking back to our question on just distribution its now clear that favouring the disadvantaged is not only the just and ethical thing to do but also the pragmatic pathway forward to building a more resiliant and thus regenerative world! 

Great, so how does one consider the deployment of resources? That requires us to think about the variety matching between agents concerning their capabilities and capacity. Capabilities are the skills necessary for agents to interface; language, technology, knowlege etc. while capacities are the degree to which an agent is skilled in a given activity. 

What capabilities and capacities are needed? Pragmatically speaking this depends and changes; one set of capabilities this moment, others at a different degree of intensity the next. Our own resourcing and resourcefulness has a lot to do with it. Whats baseline? What are our imperatives? 

## Why?
Systemic pressures and imperatives will require our just distribution to be strategic.
While the network aims to regenerate planetary health it can't do so without subsistence; ledgers in that respect are quite alive. 

They need 'food' in the form of utility such as apps that create transaction velocity; art, NFTs and EcoCredits. Following on from these needs is 'security' in the form of network effects and adoption. And finally they need 'socialisation' in the form of community currencies and mutual credit to create positive sum dynamics. 

Ok so were begining to see a pattern; people, planet, protocol - harnessing markets, science, and technology. 

The Regen protocol serves people and planet by harnessing markets, science and technology.
