# Distributed Governance Implementation Plan

Starting at Regen Foundation, the first of many double binds I've been tasked with was the creation of a distributed governance implementation plan. The title of Ledger Governance Coordinator also being another catch 22 that can only exist in the worlds of form and ideas! So what do these words represent and what have the conjured?

Take a deep breath; we're working in an industry thats never existed before so we must take action with imagination, drama and creativity; it's the only way to create the future we are collectivly envisioning. 

> Life's what happens when your busy making other plans ~John Lennon

## What?
Lets get into it; what's the ask behind the question here? For the plan to be distributed it means that it's authorship need be distributed and so the participants must necessarily write it. How does the community do that given it's already alive and poly-centric? 

The networks communication changes immanently as participants constantly adapt to the living world; a realm thats communicating rapidly all the time. Vaues and information are everywhere so how does one find significance in this avalanche? Did you know that every one of us emits a million biophotons a second with the intensity of a candle light two miles away yet the consistancy of a lazerbeam? ~**Cosmic Serpent** (fact check the quoted data). 

Given that we know the network is a complex adaptive system then any plan or cannoical source of truth is a necessary myth; a speculation on the future which eventually brings itself into existence. Any attempt at codifying such a plan can only be a speculative snapshot riddled with immediacy bias. Trust me I tried. Let's abandon the plan and update our thinking.

What's really at play here is an emergent process and so to work with it we must call upon a consistent method and reference to act as a stable baseline or measure. What's that look like though? It seems we need a keystone methodology that is global in scope but can be applied to specific instances and scenarios; without such a method we have no baseline - just an arbitrary selection of ad hoc methods that may or may not work in a given context. Is there such abstraction layer? Phew that's a tough metaphysical question to answer but we need one if we are to integrate all voices and stakeholders. This all points us back towards to a real time process of action learning. 

If we are simply copying what has been it will continue indefinitly forever. If we want or need something new, such as our envisioned futures how do we do create them? Again we're back to process and methodology; deductive logic cannot serve us here as its complicated and we're working with adapting complexity or even chaos. Inductive logics such as 'systems thinking' are better but lack dicipline in their structure and sequence so theres often no clear direction - still, statistically speaking a wrong map is better than no map [cite source] . In order to succeed with our task of planetary regeneration then we must integrate both forms of reason and leverage abductive logic; looking to priors to make inferences forward. Walking backwards in the darkness one foot at a time. 

## How?
Pragmatically though, let get into the weeds and endevour to continue the thought experiment in a practical context. How do we to reach our desired end state of planetary regeneration? Let's look at priors in the Regen Ecosystem and try to figure out what has happened and better infer our pathways forward. 

To start the process of planetary regeneration you need a vehicle of sorts; a soverign entity or perhaps a semi-digital republic? Starting at ground zero; viability depends on a sufficient variety of participants for something to catalyse. A cause. 

In Regens case an initial catalist might be considered Gregories eight forms of capital or the emergence of RND who acted as the networks progenitors. From what I know RND came into being by working for Cosmos as a development hub; this brought in and sustianed resources needed to build the Regen ledger.

For this ledger to exist though; an ecosystem of participants running nodes must also be gathered requiring further communications, outreach and coordination. With this validator network in place we have data integrity is ensured thats all for now. Here we must ask who are the validators in the set? What are their ethics and commitments? Gladly, those who are not anonymous to me all seem of strong principal and good character.  

To ensure the vision stays on course it's then necessary to make contingency plans against economic pressures by continuing to curate the ecosystem while passing over vision stewardship to a non-profit. In Regens case the foundation stewards 30% of the ledgers tokens in order to grow the capabilities and capacity towards impact by distributing them in a just manner. 

Whats justice then? If you trust Plato, justice can be interpreted to be the distribution of inequity to privilage. Like most social systems this will be a long tail distribution with roughly a 70/30 split. Outliers on the tail of inequity could in particular use a hand up in the world as it's extreamly demanding work to hang onto the long tail; extractive market mechanisms and structural violence inflicts untold damage on these people and consequentially the planet. This makes the distribution clear.

With distribution clear we know that the long tail is where the majority of our resources should go in order for the distribution to be equitable. As you'll hear from MacKenzie Scott and other Philantropists; diricting funds towards impact means making extreamly difficult decisions under uncertainty. Should we prioritise the short head or the long tail? An apparent paradox also begins to present itself when considering network growth over time.

When thinking about mainstream matters or non-living things like toaster sales the best place is to invest your resources in the short head. However, humans are not toasters; toasters are complicated and fragile while humans are complex adaptive living beings and this needs to be taken into account. We are the most advanced technology nature has ever produced (or third most advanced if you ask Arthur C. Clarke). In perturbing social systems, the long tail is where the moon shots dwell.

The general principle of hormeisis applies; adversity under the right conditions breeds resiliance. So where do we find the most adverse contitions; the long tail or the short head? It's becoming pretty clear that favouring the disadvantaged is not only the just and ethical thing to do but also the pragmatic pathway forward towards building a more resiliant and regenerative world! 

Ok, that's the basic conceptual framework sorted out but there are other considerations to be figured out such as network priorities over time. Here we need to start thinking about variety matching; interaction and interfacing between agents. How do we match capabilities and capacities?

For clarity of nomenclature, capabilities are skills such as language, technical proficiency, knowlege, legal status and other 'super powers'. Capacities are then the degree to which an agent or organisation is skilled in a given capability - these can be gradiated or binary. 

Grounding things to our current context; basic English is probably enough to interface with our team but legal status is a binary property necessity for the enDAOment programme. We can easily scope these properties to form a minimum viable enDAOment model. What about candidate capabilities, qualities and properties? What's necessary and whats sufficient? This is a more instrumental question but these pragmatics need to be considered if the network as a whole is to succeed in its task of Regeneration.   

Pragmatically speaking qualitive prioritisation depends on a constantly shifting context in both organism/organisation and environment; one set of qualities this moment, others with a different degree of intensity the next. Internal resourcing and resourcefulness will have a lot to do with meeting the outer world with grace. 

Do we have sufficient internal variety as an organisation to cross all the terrains we seek to cross in meeting all agents or is inclusivity an ideal? What are the imperatives at the network level that need accounting for in our decision process? Systemic pressures will require our distribution to be strategic in its application; for the network to provide service, the network itself must subsist. Other than a just distribution; what are the practical constraints and pathways around network subsistance? 

In this respect ledgers are quite alive; they need 'food' in the form of utility such as apps that create transaction velocity; art, NFTs and EcoCredits and so forth. Following on from these needs is 'security' in the form of network effects and mass adoption. Finally they need 'socialisation and self actualisation' in the form of community currencies and mutual credits that create positive sum dynamics between participants and beyond. Where do we direct our attention at a given moment?

 Well as mentioned it seems our efforts must be threefold (utility, security, social) and change in an adaptive dynamic manner. Currently in Regens evolution the network pressures are most likely around utility - though the seeds of mass adoption and multi-valent social currencies are priorities that must be seeded. 

This is where resourcing comes in. We have a community pool, enDAOment allotments and a nacent venture fund. One might consider the community pool as resources for generating economic utility, the enDAOment pool to build network security through large scale participation and the nacent venture fund for social impact endevours. What does this look like over time? 

As far as the network imperatives go we must continue to compell digital activity and network velocity; in parallel we need to generate longer term security with an eye to incubating social endevours such as methodology development and eco-credits. 

If we consider imperatives in linear time starting with utilitity, then security, then social we are paradoxically operating backwards from our priorities around social justice; will this breed inequity? My thinking is such. This is why I've spent the majority of my time as coordinator working off chain on goverance first. We need an autonomous receptical of sufficient variety, complexity and maturity to govern itself and the eventually the network. 

Phew, thats an ask but its nearly coalesced into being. Special interest will continously need to be paid towards the of onboarding of stewards, underrepresented demographics and network utility; ideally all three should be integrated through practice based methodologies and the subsequent generation of eco credits. This is where Regens science team and registry of practice based methodologies come into play. 

To bootstrap a registry it needs to be taken seriously, so we must onboard proven methodologies with sufficient scientific rigor first. Existence. Once the platform is functioning and has curated selection of methods with large degrees of prestige we can start loosening our criterea to include less western ways of thinking. After all most of the work being done globally will be done by the long tail; local practices. These smaller enterprises are often excluded from systemic participation due to the high bars of instutitional criterea and under resourcing. 

How do we open this market up? By enabling them to create their own credit classes based on local practices. The least speculative path to adoption would be to follow the institutional model by practicing a given methodology, making projections about its outcome and taking measurements along the way. This is high overhead, uncertain and probably far too much of a burden for many small holders to engage with. The more speculative path is growing a practice by submitting a plan, issuing credits and then continue doing the work to deliver value. These forms of credit are essentially speculative but is a fastest way to bootstrap a new credit class from the bottom up. The two pathways are not mutually exclusive and the latter can feed into the former.

However, opening the latter pathway for small holders brings with it a set of challenges around registry quality and curation. If anyone can create a class, how do we verify its integrity? This gets into the realm of peer review and attestations, even then its unlikely the credit will meet the rigerous criterea of large scale purchasers like Microsoft. A blockchain however is an open market with its own long tail and so consumers may wish to purchase these practice based credit in order to support local agriculture. The speculative nature of these currencies will also attract traders. Uh oh.

How do we avoid bad money driving out the good money? This is an important question; if the debasement of curreny can bring down the Roman Empire, it can bring down a blockchain. We need to be verrrry careful here and ask what forms of currency can be used to purchase EcoCredits? Necessarily these need to be non-speculative in nature and tied to real world values. Since pretty much all currency is fiat thats hard. But actually its not; there are credits tied to real assets already in our ecosystem. Tucan just launched a carbon credit tied to the Verra registry for example; this is a non-speculative currency but we'll need moar! 

Taking all this as a whole and reflecting back on the "what", "how" and "why" we begin to see a mission statement:

> The Regen protocol serves people and planet by harnessing markets, science and technology. 

Do you notice a reciprocol nature and pattern integrity in the relationship between these components?
