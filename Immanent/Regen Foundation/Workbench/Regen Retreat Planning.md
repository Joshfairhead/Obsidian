Hey folks, thanks for your responses to the doodle.  

Myself, Will and Austin gathered yesterday to figure out how to best move forward. The three of us discussed if we should revert to March 10-11th as previously planned, due to the availability signals we've recieved so far. I'm sending you a calendar invite for those dates so you can tentativly block the time or signal inavailability by rejecting the invite. From there we'll regroup and make decisions; either confirming that the gathering will go ahead on those dates, or that we need to adapt once again. 

Some have inquired into location as well. Three regions have been under consideration; Barbados, Cuzco and Costa Rica. Although there is some history and ties to the ground in Barbados it appears that the accomodation is booked out during the March dates so thats looking unlikely. Costa Rica and Cuzco are still living potentialities; the visa processing time for Cuzco is much faster that Costa Rica so it looks like the direction to go. We'll have more detalis on those locations as we recieve responses from the locations/entities contacted. Hopefully all this will settle into place by the end of next week. 

In the meantime; please signal your availability for the March dates by responding to the calandar invitation. 

Warmest
