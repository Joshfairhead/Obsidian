## EnDAOment Process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for the lab is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- A labs session occurs on zoom and is recorded (put on youtube) by foundation representative
- During the lab parties find synnergy and continue working together. 
- As labs mature into relationships enDAOment candidates are nominated by foundation representatives based on established criterea (just distributions).
- Nominees are socialised with the existing community via a pollination event and relationships form. 
- Once these relationships are mature EnDAOment candidates are selected by consensus votes

Note: it makes sense to nominate capacity builders/stewards early in this process as they will act as amplifiers. It also seems reasonable to record the number of candidates selected and check it matches our distribution criterea. It seems prudent to measure funds distributed
