### Wallet Setup
There are a number of wallets you can use on Regen but the most accessible is way to get started is to download [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) - we'll work with that for now. Keplr is a [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser extension so you'll need to alread have that or download it first as a prerequisite. 

### Steps
- Download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Open Chrome
- Download  [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) (use this link)
- Click the blue "Add" button
- "Add Keplr" window will appear
- Click the button "add extension"
- In the top right of your Chrome browser beside the address bar you'll find an icon that looks like a puzzle piece; click it to see your Chrome extensions.
- A menu will appear and at the bottom is "Keplr", click it to start your wallet.
- Do NOT sign in with Google, instead click on "create new account"
- You'll see a list of 12 words; this is important to save for account recovery (copy them and store them safely)
- Name your account however you see fit; its just for reference
- Now create a pasword that you'll remember and store it safely (in a password manager if possible)
- Keplr will check you have stored your 12 words; click them in the requested order and select done
- The screen will close as you are now done with initial wallet setup
