### Commonwealth Text Proposal
Text proposals are the most basic form of proposal; they don't have any direct ramifications on the software. These are often called signalling propsals as they are largely used to poll for sentiment about a proposed change or course of action. 

- On chain proposals start life as a discussion on commonwealth
- There is a social norm of [two weeks minimum discussion](https://github.com/regen-network/governance) time before discussions are allowed to turn into proposals
- Go to commonwealth.im/regen to begin the process
- Click the `log in` button on the top right hand side of the screen
- Select `continue with wallet` and click Keplr
- You should now be logged in and able to post
- Click the `new thread` button
- A drop down menu appears
- Click `new on-chain proposal`

- Add a deposit in micro regen (add six zeros for each Regen). This deposit acts as a spam filter; you must hold tokens to participate in onchain governance and poll for opinion.
