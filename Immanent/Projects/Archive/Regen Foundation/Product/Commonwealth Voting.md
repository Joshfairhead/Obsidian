### Commonwealth voting
For token holdles, commonwealth voting is a key function. You can either do this yourself or you can delegate to a validator, usually determined by your wallet.

- Go to commonwealth.im/regen 
- Click the `log in` button in the top right hand corner of the page
- Select `connect with wallet`
- Select Keplr as the option in the drop down list
- In the menu on the left hand side of the screen click `proposals`to view the active proposals
- Select the proposal you wish to engage with
- Make sure to read the proposal and understand what it's about and consider its impact; there should have been a discussion thread if you need a refresher on the wider context.
- Once you've read the proposal and are at the bottom of the text, you should see four options:
	- Yes (the proposal is agreeable)
	- No (the proposal is disagreeable)
	- Abstain (engaged with the proposal but no opinion)
	- No with veto (the proposal is disagreeable and the poster shoul loose some tokens)
- No with veto is typically used when a proposal skips the discussion period and is put straingt on chain. There are some exceptions to this norm for urgent matters such as security issues.
- Click the option of your choice
- Keplr will open and ask you to sign a transaction
- You've now placed your vote! 
- Come back at the end of the voting period to see the outcome
