# Decentralised Registry Programme Overview

The registry takes a middle out approach combinding top down institutional grade products with bottom up and emergent methodologies. This is reffered to as the "environmental stewardship programme". 

The top down pathway is just like traditional registries; there's an outcome that needs to be achieved through a practice of regular measurement, verification and reporting. These adhere to a strict set of standards already recognised by institutions and large scale investors. 

The bottom up pathway is much more 'wild' and decentralised. Independent climate activists post their plans, issue speculative credits and engage in their regenerative practice. The plan is considered by a pannel of experts with their assessment of the method issued as the project is onboarded.
