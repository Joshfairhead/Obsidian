# Questions
**Regen Registry**
1) Why SSI for identity stack? What do you see the major pluses with a sovrin kind of system. Can the member farmers plug in with the existing identifiers, whatsoever they are maintaining?  
2) Are there some examples of DQP? Is there an incentive mechanism for someone playing the role of improving or validating the quality of data as well.  
3) How are the ecological contracts made? Is there an exemplar contract giving end-to-end view of the process and components used.  
4) What ways Regen tokens be used. Can I create a DeFi out of Regen tokens? Any examples for the same.  
5) Regen seems to have borrowed and built on top of IXO and they have this concept of Risk Adjusted Bonding Curves? Is it what Regen also uses? How/ where?  
6) What are some examples of DAPs? It would be interesting to see if the data marketplace envisaged in Regen leverage FarmStack. FarmStack has features that can enable a data marketplace.

1.  Working with the Regen Registry
	-   How do we ascertain if a natural climate solution fits into an existing credit class?
	-   Are that any impediments in classifying forest residue biochar as a credit class?
	-   How do you suggest we think about choosing to work with either Verra or Climate Action Reserve in applying a carbon accounting methodology to our biochar project?
	-   Beyond adopting an approved methodology, what else do we need to do before listing biochar on the Regen Registry
	-   Are there pending methodologies to calculate carbon stockpiled in trees and plants?
	-   Would it be beneficial or unhelpful for KCT to list carbon credits with multiple registries?

1.  Understanding Regen Tokens
	-   Can you help us understand the best use of Regen tokens awarded as part of our grant?

1.  Integrating carbon conservation trusts into the Regen Network
	-   Help us understand the vertical integration features of the Regen Registry and whether these constitute the best solution for biochar and other natural climate solutions
	-   Can we discuss how you see the attributes of the Regen Registry and carbon trust model combining to valorize carbon credits for biochar and other natural climate solutions?

1.  Helping KCT interface effectively with the RND
	-   How do we best engage our RND advisors in support of the KCT workgroup developing protocols that conform to our project plans with RND methodologies and standards?
	-   Is it realistic to look to the RND community for research support for KCTâ€™s workgroup process and feedback on our work products, such as that identified in the outline?
	-   How much should we budget for an RND account, project review, and methodology review fees?
	-   Are members of the RND community available to help KCT develop smart contracts?

1.  EnDAOed communities
	-   Please help us understand the pros & cons of organizing carbon trusts and/or workgroups as DAOs?
	-   Do you think DAO governance would be appropriate for KCT workgroups?
	-   Are carbon conservation trusts suitable enDAOed communities of practitioners?
	-   Would an enDAOed conservation trust serve a practice area or a geographic region?
