# Registry Quickstart

What is the Registry?
- The registry is a collection of ecosystem services available within the Regen Network. 

Can anyone register?
- Yes, unlike other registries we take a middle out approach combining top down instutional grade criterea with a looser bottom up emergent approach.

If the registry is open; how is quality maintained?
- There are three levels of tagging that allows the user to filter the registry based on their needs; credit classes, methodology and credits. Credit classes can be created by anyone but have the paramaters of provenence and methodology associated with them. These 'tags' can be combined to filter for relevant services.
