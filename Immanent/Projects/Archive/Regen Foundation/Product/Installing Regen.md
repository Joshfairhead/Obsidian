## Installing Regen
- Go to the page: https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/releases/tag/v3.0.0
- Under "Assets" download the latest binary (Mac: [regen-ledger_3.0.0_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/releases/download/v3.0.0/regen-ledger_3.0.0_darwin_amd64.zip))
- Download the file called "checksums" ([regen-ledger_3.0.0_checksums.txt](https://github.com/regen-network/regen-ledger/releases/download/v3.0.0/regen-ledger_3.0.0_checksums.txt))
- When your binary is downloaded open the command line and find the zip file
- Run the command `sha256sum ~/folder/with/regen-ledger_3.0.0_darwin_amd64.zip`
- This will output a hash in your terminal; check it matches the corresponding hash in the checksum file.
