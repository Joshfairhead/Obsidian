## S3 Notes
>Governance in an organization (or a domain within it) is the process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving those objectives. 
>
>Operations is doing the work and organizing day-to-day activities within  
the constraints defined through governance.


> For each domain in an organization there is a governing body: people  
with a mandate to make and evolve agreements which govern how the  
people doing the work in that domain create value.  
>
> There are many ways to distribute work and governance. Sometimes the  
governing body is a single person, e.g. in the case of a manager who  
leads others. Other times a group of people govern themselves and all  
members share responsibility for governance within the constraints of  
their domain.  
>
> Governance decisions set constraints on activity and guide future decisions. They relate to matters like:  
> - Work processes  
> - Policies and procedures about how people work together  
> - Organizational structure:  
>	– Distributing responsibilities and power to influence by designing domains and selecting people to account for them  
>	– Accounting for dependencies between teams  
> - Distribution of resources  
> - Strategy (for the whole organization, for a team, product or role),  
> - Priorities and objectives  
> - Consequential decisions about products, services, tools, technology,  
security etc.  
>
>Depending on the context, a team might make governance decisions:  
> - in dedicated governance meetings that are scheduled on a regular  
basis  
> - on the fly, during the working day  
> - in a one-off meeting to deal with a specific topic  
> - in other types of meetings such as product meetings, planning meetings or retrospectives, etc.  
>
> Wherever and whenever you make governance decisions, one thing worth  
considering is documenting them somehow. This way you’ll be able to  
remember what was agreed, so will others, and you’ll have something to  
come back to when it’s time to review.




S3 Domains: 
> A domain is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision making  
within an organization. Inadequately defined domains typically lead to stakeholders having different assumptions about areas of responsibility and autonomy.

> The domain’s primary driver - the main driver the delegatee(s) respond to: 
	- the set of subdrivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to the domain’s primary driver, which include:  
		– key responsibilities (any driver following directly from the domain’s primary driver)  
		– dependencies and external constraints (drivers relating to other domains or to the environment beyond the organization) that constrain the delegatees’ autonomy
