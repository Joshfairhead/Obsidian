# Gregory Update

Hey Gregory, I thought I'd check in with an update in the spirit of offer. There are a couple of things that come to mind as I think of you so I'll start by sharing output first as field setting before getting more speculative and macro.

From running the community call and listening to community voices I've put together an orientation guide answering many of the onboarding FAQ's with guides and guidelines for community participation in the descriptive form. I'm aware that Dan's working on token voting which is the missing piece. 

Getting a bit less present tense the next items getting attention are the Registry team crypto/governance/design docs (primarily Me and Tica as a nacent WG, with Dan offering help looped in via Rebecca). I'm also in sync with Ryan about ledger docs which are a bit more tricky to get done due to their nature (my experience/computer) but I believe they are achievable in the near future. Flight test tomorrow making sense of the screen grabs I took from his terminal. 

Other nearing futures are things like the IST community calls and other spaces. Gijs is receptive of heading the EurAisia Community calls and bi-weekly peer learning sessions. I believe Austin is headed towards enDAOment office hours at this stage he's been talking about it for a while but perhaps it's actually just the Regenerati call with Rebecca? My perception is your passing them both that ball together which makes a lot of sense. 

The other Twitter space getting set up is the Validator Ecosystem Resilliance fishbowl. I'm hoping to roll it into a kinda casual shark tank style gameshow where proposals come in for discussion and then the validators assess network impact and ideally help shape them. The wheels are in motion on that one, no idea if it'll float but I've seeded the idea with the marketing team.

Getting more speculative again, I'm sensing interesting crossovers with my Giveth history so reached out to Kay for the more nuanced detials. It seem's the web34life guild have started using their platform to recieve donations for the cultural campfire... This is perhaps one of those edges worth exploring between staking, reputation, governance token edges you mentioned in our last interaction? 

While common wealth caters to the more active voting and distribution audience; it seems that Giveth is a pretty good recepticle on the inverse side. The reconciller is then perhaps W34L? I've been directing energy that way and some quite capable folks are beginning to orbit that container (including OpenTEAM peeps)... I could suggest other facillitators in the community to do the same. If the technology is interoperable I could onboard the current community call participants to the group module and try set up an allocation comittee to fund the individual campains!? What are your vibes there? 

I believe there's a passive shock inbound on that group so it would be nice to help the guild and others through this process asap; it kinda feels like I'm the outside energy that's needed to get them through...Propose on Commonwealth, transparently recieve on Giveth? meta-community as the reconciller. Maybe I'm just nuts. 

Closing thought is that this kind of update is probably helpful for others in ways but unsuited to most channels; I'm thinking the newsletter thats recently emerged but perhaps not. I've written it in Obsidian so it goes to github live, do you mind if I share the link and see how others feel. I imagine a monthly mail to you like this is probably helpful?

Warmest,
j
