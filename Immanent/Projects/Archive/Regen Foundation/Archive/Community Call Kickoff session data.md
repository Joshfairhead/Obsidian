# Community Call Kickoff Session Data

## Horizon one (issues)
- One dimensional nature of Carbon as indicator of regenerative health
- discrepancy between land time and digital time
- Current crypto solutions are not intuitive to land stewards
- H1 governments not utilising Blockchain data enough to identify and reward ecosystem services
- Methods for people to track and get credit for the practice of their work not just the outcome
- Lack of funds to sustain us doing this work
- Lack of connectivity & cohesion between people, projects, etc.
- Difficult to access funding that allows one to sustain themselves while doing regenerative work
- Supply side unaware of solution and tools to access monetization of ecosystem benefits
- Land is very expensive
- Multi stakeholder mapping and prioritisation
- Discomfort with engaging the living world as "ecosystem services"
- Burden of data, measurements and verification
- lack of comfort,  confidence, time engaging online
- Lack of individual & collective capacity to co-create generative solutions
- market acceptance of non-carbon eco credits
- creating digital platforms for folks on the ground
- confidence in outcomes 
- Needing to develop the new paradigm tech to facilitate our projects
- Lack of easy education to existing methodologies
- Difficultly in creating decentralized geospatial registries
- Governments not utilising Blockchain data enough to identify and reward ecosystem services 
- Takes some effort and knowledge to onboard to the system to create a methodology
- Takes some effort and knowledge to onboard to the system to create a methodology


## Horizon two (change)
- Community engagement around ethical tech standards
- Mainstream awareness campaign of solutions beyond carbon
- easy access to existing knowledge base of different regenerative practices
- REGEN Ecosystem-wide grants and eco-credit growth programs.
- means for communities to share their local approach with others
- user discovery 
- Blended financing options for initial stages of eco-credit creation.
- assess how to utilize current community organization and governance on chain 
- how can we reward both $ and tokens for on the ground needs
- identify specific barriers from communities around digital participation 
- bring community voices to forefront 
- Scholarships and fellowships for non-Web3 communities
- RND as a pool of subject matter experts to engage organizations in reciprocal problem solving.
- RDN as a clearinghouse for measuring and valuing carbon
- Education and learning resources on eco-credit creation
- Incubation and acceleration support for projects and new methods
- Cultural and regenerative exchange across bioregions to share practices
- Funding to help sustain one's basic needs while doing regenerative work that is not currently incentivised by the market/public orgs
- community engagement around geospatial data standards
- Public partnerships and support for the REGEN token
- Greater Literacy in decentralized digital systems for community empowerment
- collectively authored Code of Conduct to dismantle capitalist patriarchy and support diverse participants
- More connectivity between people & projects, both with "band aids" in the old system, and early iterations of Web 3, etc.
- Some more funding in fiat, and the initial trials of other currencies for meeting needs & generating new value flows
- Be the funnel :
	1. Usecases 
	2. Discovery
	3. Education
	4. Financial models
	5. Onboarding 

## Horizon three (outcomes)

- Empowered smallholders participating in eco-credit creation with minimal barriers
- Including hyperlocal solutions into planetary governance
- self-organizing and governing systems
- Support and amplification of traditional ecological knowledge practices
- If small land holders can be empowered and participate = success
- RADIATE narratives of eco and social change
- variety of financial mechanisms for rewards
- land steward-centric UI and forums
- Easy access to market for solutions beyond carbon.
- Breaking through the complexity and speculative reputation of of blockchain so that it can be trusted as a currency for ecosystem services
