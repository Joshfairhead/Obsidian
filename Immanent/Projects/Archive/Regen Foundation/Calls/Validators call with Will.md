# Validators call with Will

Cosmos station / mint scan 

- Gov votes by validators can be found via Cosmos station / mint scan 
	- This can help inform our delegator strategy
	- Chain flow have provided services but are seemingly not voting
		- This is interesting because it indicates that they are active in the community but perhaps engagement in governance is irreevant to them or they are happy with the crowds direction
		- Validators may vote without knowing about the issue
		- Validators may also refrain from voting if they don't understand the issue
	- Gov proposal passed to raise the amount of validators from 50 -> 75
		- This means there are now new people involved that are relativly fresh to the ecosystem
		- There are an additional 15 validators lined up that are validating but not recieving rewards
			- They are doing this to accumulate a staking pool and eventually get in the door
		- Validators provide services
			- Wallets
			- Block explorers
			- Buddy system for CSDAOs 
			- Others support communities on the ground
	- The inflation rate is about $20k
