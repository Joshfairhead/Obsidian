Revs
- Some missing. Part of bigger whole.
- Should think about endaoment and ecosystem as thats the higher nature of the org map. 
- If going for an articulation of domains we should look at what we spend our time doin and what we would like the org to spend its time doing. 
- A hidden part is the operations/tools/processes/fundraising 
- Marketing seen as external team but integral to these activities and need to be open to the ecosystem. Its a question of who does that and playing to our strengths 
- Who do we need to account for? Partners, pre/post endaoment candidates, RND and the larger ecosystem. Does this matter or does it map differently? Specific goal around consortium interaction. Is there a place for the larger ecosystem and how we interact with the world.


- The mission is the edges between nodes. The mission flows through all these. How is our mission being articulated between all of these flows?
- How do we think of hierachy? 
- Pointing at our operations, and defining the buckets
