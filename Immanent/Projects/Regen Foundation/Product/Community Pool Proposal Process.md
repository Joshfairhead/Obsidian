## Community Pool Proposal Process:
- A call for participation occurs on a community platform (of any variety)
- A date and location for public sense making is shared with interested parties (callers discretion)
- A sense making session then occurs publicaly via community platform with a foundation representation present (e.g. Discord or Twitter Space)
- Parties that find synnergy and wish to continue worknig together start a proposal discussion on common wealth; optionally creating a presentation to share on a public platform (e.g. Community call)
- This off chain presentation serves to drive proposal discussion on the commonwealth forum before the calling party deems that sufficient discussion has occured in order to finalise a proposal
- The proposal is then polished with foundation representative sign off and then put to an on chain vote; should mention various criterea (team, resources, capabilities, talents etc.)
- Proposal passes or fails based on validator discresion

Note: it makes sense to measure discussion time and voting turn out on commonwealth. Before proposal discussion length shortened participation was higher. Current measure is  63%~
