- A menu will appear and at the bottom is "Keplr", click it to open your wallet.
- Type your password into Keplr and click "unlock"
- At the top of the Keplr window between the hamburger menu and the icon of a person you'll see a network name - probably "cosmos hub"
- Click this for a drop down menu and scroll down to find "Regen" and select it as your network
- "Cosmos hub" will now read "Regen" instead
- A little below you'll see a set of characters like "regen1pc6x4v4sxlf...05cy3tt4w", this is your wallet address
- Click it to copy your address (you'll see a notification of "address copied")
- You can share this with others and they will be able to send you tokens. 
- Ask a friend to send you a test transaction of a small amount just to make sure everythings working
