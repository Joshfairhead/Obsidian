# Governance of Registry Parameters

Being a decentarlised registry, paramaters changes such as credit classes or credit issuance is governed by on-chain voting practices. For instance, the curation of a credit class may be crowd sourced. 

Token holders can vote on projects belonging to different classes. Grounding this slightly the "CarbonPlus" credit class is currently stewarded by RND but soon may choose to authorise a body of experts from the Earthshot institute to assess relevant methodologies for inclusion into this class (or not). 

The mechanism behind this is known as a token curated registry or TCR pattern. Token holders essentially lock some of their tokens into escrow and vote on two options - yes or no - based on the outcome they believe the majority of participants will vote on. If they select the correct outcome they are rewarded, if they select the incorrect outcome they loose a percentage of the tokens they locked into escrow.
