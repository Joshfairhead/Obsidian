# Ecosystem Resilliance

This is discussion is more an offering, than proposal or request. It's a story of offes that wish to keep giving in the spirit of inter-ecosystem agency, healing and catharsis. Let me provied some field setting:

During the 'great Ether crash of 2018', like many people I was made redundant. I was working on Pillar Project, a "personal data locker"  thats now turned a community governed crypto wallet. As far as product experience goes in the blockchain world it's still pretty good. Peers recommended I get job at Facebook and other well paying companies who were spinning up blockchain divisions, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Instead I joined Giveth - a well known crypto charity in the ethereum space where I helped spin up the Commons Stack (now a Regen csDAO). The spirit of our mission was to enable social service, so I self funded my ride. .

The crypto ecosystem was in a pretty bad shape back then and the chasam proved too dark to cross. Taking soul out of this game broke my heart, levaing a deep sense of fragmentation that is asking to reassemble itself.

I'm currently sensing a harmonic of my experiences that I'd hope for us to avoid. Numerous community members are taking on risk by provisioning events on behalf of Regen andthe broader inter-chain community, while others are consistently answering our calls for participation. 

The Giveth and Commons Stack story line resumes in relation to Web34Life though. After watching the first community call the guild got in contact to build relationships offering their gifts of a community run cultural campfire. To help leigtimise thieir work within the ecosistem I offered to become an advisor which became controversial due to a percieved conflict of interest and so the guild abandoned their proposal. 

None the less the guild continued to te invest in our ecosystem by supporting it with unpaid care work. It seems that Instead of making a a Commonwealth proposal to `request` a communtiy spend (appropriation) they have moved over to Giveth to signal their `offering` as while continuing to provision work. 

When I noticed this yesterday, I considered making a Commonwealth proposal on their behalf using the Giveth address as recipient. However due to technical constraints this is not yet possible; Giveth runs on xDai and Regens built on Cosmos. This idea was a dead end.

However the story is not over; while I put my soul in the game for Giveth/CS without renumeration; when the GIV economy went live Griff sent out a message to tell exparticipants that they've been airdropped a bunch of GIV tokensand that he was provisioning liquidity in a bonding curve for those that wanted to sever ties and sell out; I closed the message and did nothing. 

However now that that W34L have moved their offering to Giveth my heart has changed. At first my head went to the community pool but those are not my own funds to appropriate and lacking Regen tokens, I do not have a say on community spends anyway. Besides this, making a direct proposal to fund them is a no go due to the mentioned technical incompatibility. 

Sill, I've been emotionally perturbed about this subject as I firmly believe that care work such as cross community culture buildng is THE most valuable offering any party make. I'm strongly inclined to reciprocate in kind.

So what to do about it? Well as mentioned I've been a reluctant and unsuspecting GIV token holder. The Regen community campfire is an offer they placed directly on Giveth. As such I've taken a risk and mobilised my own 'social capital' on their behalf and have donated several thousand dollars worth of GIV tokens to keep the Regen ecosystem fly wheel spinning; a risk I'm more than willing to take on due to the unquantifiable value they are bringing to the ecosystem.

While I've done taken this action and personally donated to the Regen community campfire I'd like to see a thriving ecosystem of facillitators building capacity. There are others waaaay out on a limb that are putting their free hands up to do this kind of work as well, Jillian Hovey is a good example. 

However it's not in a givers nature to request renumeration, let alone reduce thier qualitive offerings to quantive number that can be enumerated through a community spend proposal. How do WE value this kind of work? Speaking for myself, I value it very highly - though I also struggle to put a number on it.

My donations to Web34Life and Jillian have been given without expectation so far but it's a form of patronage that I consider unsustainable. Making these gestures has the potential create unhealthy power asymmetries which I felt first hand during my Giveth days. These donations are personal gifts, however I cannot make them again or for everyone; the creation of such  dependencies I consider unethical due to the potential to create "cargo cults". 

With that said I have a very strong sense that by provisioning liquidity and acting as a market maker between ecosystems I can help drive real grounded utility for both networks. By offering to act as an intrim market maker between GIV and REGEN tokens I can theoretically facillitate the exchange between Regen's staking tokens and Giveth's social tokens; letting the thousand currencies bloom. I'd also become a Regen token holder (necessary for a 'ledger gov coordinator' IMO) by distributing soul across both games. 

This is the Giveth record of my transaction:

I've acted autonomously and made the gesture at my own risk. I completly accept this. I can either be a one time patron (do nothing) or contineous a market maker (act), - what would the Regen validator community prefer?1
