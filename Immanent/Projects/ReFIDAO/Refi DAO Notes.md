Robin: Kumu is about financing credits and new projects. Supporting corporate purchases. Lock in credits at a desirable price. Control a loan against the credits for purchase at the appropriate time. Waiting for the carbon standards to make a move. Cares about the space moving forward and trying to build ourselves.

Jari: mapping primitives for his project. Real world refi business finance; could leese solar pannels from us. Are you stitching stuff together. How do you deal with Identity? What about KYC / AML.

If you want a loan or to redeem on primary markets you need to be KYC. Secondary markets not necessary. Keen on MIKA (EU Regs). Working with project devs to understand their needs and onboard them.

Liquidity from maker DAO for colatteral ratios. 6hrs unlock undercollateralised vaults. Stability pools to get discounts. Carbon credits are difficult to price, needs oracle working with chain link to determine precise end price without interfearing with DEFI manipulation.
