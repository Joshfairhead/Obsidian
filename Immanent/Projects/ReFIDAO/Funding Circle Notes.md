if anyone has a project, but you don't have the time/expertise/bandwidth to ideate a project and write/submit a grant, I have a team (PMs, solutions engineers, tech writers, community managers, etc) that can help with the grant application process. we can also help with recruiting external dev talent and managing the execution of the grant project

we just helped four projects apply for grants for FutureQuest. our focus is sustainability & open source public goods infrastructure.

Right now in the current climate web 2 investors are down regulating funding growth startups and now prioritising revenue producing startups.

How important in grant funding allocation criteria is it that the projects are focused on an early path to revenue over a growth play that would then monetise at a later stage.
