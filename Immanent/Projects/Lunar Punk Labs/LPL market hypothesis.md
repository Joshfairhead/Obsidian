# LPL Market Hypothesis

## Introduction
In this post we're going to look at the investibility of the climate space while avoiding subjective appeals to values. This post aims to ground our hypothesis in the exestential facts of the market in order to explain why our enterprise is a strong long term investment opportunity. 

### Player Personas
There are two base investment archetypes. Alpha investors and beta investors. These actors structure their portfolios differently according to percieved costs, risks and benefits. In particular risk tolerance is the major differentiator. 

1) Alpha investors are risk-on speculators. They seek to exploit market asymetries to beat it.
2) Beta investors are risk-off speculators. They seek to grow with the market in order to beat inflation while compounding wealth to secure the future.

At scale both these archetypes are both looking towards ESG indicators for different reasons. Both have mandates to work on behalf of their share holders but they cater to different audiences. Let's look at some instantiations of these archetypes:

1) Hedge funds; these folk are alpha investors whos primary agenda is to see number go up for their shareholders, though some elements of corporate responsibility also come into play. 
2) Pension funds; these folk are beta investors whos primary concern is to preserve wealth while **serving the public interest**. 

### Market Realities
These agents are both looking at ESG (environmental, socail and governace) indicators. Why? 

In the case of our risk adverse pension funds its pretty obvious; these indicators articulate a broad domain of public intrests (articulated by the top down) and an index of natural capital investments can preserve wealth. However the risk-on hedge funds are another story.

Beyond simple virtue signalling there are $5T+ in stranded assets trading on Wall St. books. These are below ground fossil fuel investments that have been financialised but cannot be extracted; this capital will either have to be written off or divested. As divestment is clearly the preferable to these entities the matter of concern becomes for them becomes where to allocate this capital that can generate returns. 

At this point in time the hedge fund investments into ESGs seem to be plattitudes; most of their ESG portfolios tend to consist of tech stocks because they are 'low carbon' which from our perspective is essentially just green washing. Natural capital is stable enough for pension funds but it would seem there's not enough delta in it for risk-on speculators to capture; perhaps goverment and corporate subsidies will perturb the shift? This is a possibility but it seems unlikely. What's needed here is new markets and deep innovation that brings about new vehicles and investment opportunites.

Let's take ESG's as an abstract meta-category and attempt to ground them in more actionable heuristics by using them to encapsulate other ontological frameworks. Natural Capital and Payments for Ecosystem Services seem to fit neatly as 'submodules' in the enviromental basket. The former attempts to value noun like resources, while the latter attempts to value verb like services. When we look at the social and governance categories it would seem that DEIJ's fit nicely. Diversity and inclusion are social values, while justice and equity are governance values.

- Natural Capital
- Payments for ecosystem services
- Justice
- Equity
- Diversity
- Inclusion

At this point there are 15 edges of interaction between the nodes articulated. We will not cover them all; just note that they exist. We could also broaden our scope for enhanced resolution regarding critical pathways but for now let's avoid overwhelming ourselves.

### Decision integrity
Speaking pragmatically, any intervention we wish persue in the space of regenerative markets will want to tick these boxes. The science and technology come secondary. How do we approach integrating these values? a gini coefficient about covers it all as a distribution of values.

When thinking about distribution graphs there is:
1) The short head ~30%
2) The long tail ~70%

Such graphs are applicable in many contexts but remaining grounded in market realities let's explore what this means to our two flavours of investors. 

The Short Head:
- Generic
- Popular
- Explicit
- Short lived

The Long Tail:
- Specific
- Niche
- Implicit
- Resiliant

The short head is the dominant paradigm. In markets it's the obvious high return assets like fossil fuels and carbon. Because they are generic and popular their opportunity for alpha doesn't last long; other market participants spot the opportunity and the edge quickly dissipates. 

The long tail is an aggrigate of specific niche opportunities that aren't immediatly obvious; the value is often implicit in the enterprise activities - ESGs as indicatiors are examples of such qualitive values that are not easily expressed in quantifiable dollar denominations. Translation becomes an issue, which is why they are currently failing as an investment opportunity. How do we 'productise' such implicit qualitive values and express them in an explicit quantitive manner that can generate returns? We need to encapsulate them in a unitive abstraction that enables financialisation through fungibility.

Assuming we can 'square the circle' and quantify the qualitive this way, we can readily see that there is much more value in the long tail than the short head. Not only that but this is also where 'moon shots' come from in the form of outliers. How do we make this long tail investible? We need a means to value proof-of-regeneration.

As noted, the constraint on this is that for such a proof to be profitable we need fungibility through quantification. Natural capital addresses this statically by counting the objects (carbon tonnes etc.) but this isn't suficient if we want to get beyond goverment subsidies and pension funds. We need uncertainty and alpha opportunities; with such we can make it fucking rain for the long tail! 

This is where our scientific hypothesis starts to become important because we are essentially trying to value a unifying measurement. This quantifier is free energy. 





How do we direct quantifiable financial capital that lives downstream towards the stewards producing qualitive value upstream? The heart of this question is about redistribution and optimising our gini coefficient. 



In the realm of ESGs this is environmental stewardship, regenerative and holistic practices. Human protocols that create implicit value by regenerating people and places. Again its easy to value life, vitality and creativity - but these values are not easily quantifiable so how do we financialise them in a generative way?
