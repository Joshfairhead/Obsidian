[[LPL market hypothesis]]

## Introduction
This essay seeks to express a means of transforming financial capital from a quantifier that externalises it's costs, into a quantifier that interanlises them as values. We will achieve this by converting markets from an exestential liability into our greatest regenerative asset by aggrigating all forms of value into a single measurable proxy of free energy over unity. 

The essay puts forth a case that this measure is the perfect investment vehicle for reshaping the market landscape. In essence I'm asserting that we can harnesses greed and speculation to divest humanity out of a debt based economic system into a thriving regenerative ecology. Attempts to extract value from the system will ultimatly result in postive externalities and realise locked potential. It is therefore an antifragile market mechanism that cannot be captured by the extractive nature of capitalism.

## Market Hypothesis
Before we jump into solutions - which are often unfalsifiable value assertions - we must first examine and expound our a priori assumptions about the financial system. By negating these we may see what emerges to becomes self-evident; only then might we deem a solution adequite.

#### Participants
> - Alpha investors; risk-on. Seeks return on investment.
> - Beta investors; risk-off. Seeks wealth preservation.

Our first assumption is that there are two broad sets of market participants that have different risk appetites. The first set are alpha investors and the second beta investors. The former have a high risk appetite and the latter a low risk appetite. One set of participants seeks to beat the market and the other seeks to 'be' the market. 

In order to animate these actors; let's characterise our alpha investors as hedge funds and our beta investors as pension funds. We notice that the former is incentivised by carrots in the form of profit, while the latter does it's best to avoid the stick of regulation and corporate responsibility. These core interestes of cost / risk / benefit drive market activity. 

#### Trends
A second assumption is that there are $5T of stranded assets that are traded on Wall St. books. These assets take mutliple forms but most generally speaking they are degenerative commodities like fossil fuels that are stuck below ground. If these resources are extracted the outcome will lead to planetary rent dissipation. Consequentially they must stay there.

Since such commodities have no intrinsic value and will soon need to be 'struck off' the books. In this case we note that there is a minimum of $5T in market capital that is in need of urgent divestment as these funds are essentially stuck with no place to go. Seemingly both forms of investors are in search of new 'values' as they begin to embrace qualitive indicators like ESG's as a means. One might say this is charateristic of society writ large. 

As always, there is a deal of controversy about the efficacy of such values but both parties are essentially stuck in a position where they need new investment vehicles that are both ethical and profitable. What becomes evidant here is that investors actually want to change and there is demand for it - the market is just lacking on the supply side of the equation.

#### Pathways
Provisioning ethical divestment options will thus require a new set of market makers with a completely different mentality. Instead of externalising costs these market participants will need to work on supplying products that internalise values, and will need to do so provably. This is an innovation chasm ripe for blue funds who wish to bridge the transition by making use of scientific and technological means. 

If we look at economics in terms of nouns and verbs; the internalisation of values can take two primary forms - capital and curret-sees. Capital might be framed as a noun like wholes; integrals that emerge from an aggrigation of verb like interactions aka current-sees. These implicit flows are made explicit by measuring the dynamic and adaptive state of a system and taking snapshots across time as the values change. 

Referencing our investor profiles once again it's clear that our beta investors will prefer the security noun like instruments with low volitility. Here the natural capital paradigm feels appropriate for these parties, as value does not fluctuate as wildly or change as a living system does. This is a start, but there are many issues with such an approach where we are essentially 'commoditizing' the world. Our hedge funds are also unsatisfied as there is little speculative alpha that can be captured due to the instruments stability; they need something more complex and volitile. How do we create forms of living capital? 

The key here is in valuing the verbs; flows and measures that are variable and dynamic in their nature. Keeping one eye on our goal of regenerative transformation we might direct the other half of our attention to proxy measures like organic biomass, bird song in the atmosphere, nutrient density of the crops and so forth. When we enumerate such values they take on such a hetrogeneity of forms that we find ourselves drowing in complexity. 
Consequentially there is need for a standardised ontology to integrate them all which is where distributed monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) becomes applicable.

#### Ontologies
Theoretically any form of measurement can be encapsulated by such a schema; be they qualitive social values or quantitive mechanistic values - it doesn't really matter as far as the schema is concerned. We might consider it a very low level 'API' interface. 

Still, just becase our measures have been articulated doesn't mean that they have been accounted for. To gain legitimacy in the traditional system these measures will need to be evaluated in conformance to exogonous parameters like the books of an accountant. At this point we probably need a higher level ontology thats instutionally recognised such as REA accounting. This enables the instutional evaluation of our dMRV measurements. 

We are nearly there; let's take in the view from this pleatau before carrying on up the mountain. We have a means to aggrigate measurements in the form of dMRV and we have a means to evaluate these measurements through REA accounting. The question that leads us to our mountains summit becomes; what do we evaluate our measurements against? 

With one eye still looking towards regeneration, we must consider what such a term actually means. This is undoubtedly a long metaphysical inquiry fraught with peril but let's skip writing a book on the Dramatic Universe for now and instead reference it to make an assertion; regeneration is free energy above unity - a form of harmony realised through the actualisation of potentials. 

Assuming such a statement is true, we can lean on active inferrencing (calculus) to evaluate the diversity of state measurements against a single unifying paramater. The numerical expression that arises can then function as a speculative asset; if harmony is produced over time then number goes up. If discord is produced over time then number goes down!

This market mechanism essentially provides a means to rate ESGs as well. Environmental, social and governance values can be evaluated against such a baseline. Any ontological preference set beyond this (such as DEIJs) can also be evaluated. The API is indifferent and consequentially any market that makes use of active inference to determine base lines is regenerative, unenclosable and anti-fragile. 

As this mechanism is an aggrigation over time it is subject to volitility and so fulfils hedge fund requirements for risk-on speculative markets. The more regenerative the credit the higher the profits in dollar amounts. The more profit is 'extracted' upstream the more wealth is internalised upstream. From an ethical point of view this channels energy and resources to its producers; proliteraiots and environmental stewards act as planetary generators.
