[[LPL market hypothesis]]

## Introduction
This essay seeks to express a means of transforming financial capital from a quantifier that externalises its costs, into a quantifier that interanlises them as values. We will achieve this by converting markets from an existential liability into our greatest regenerative asset by aggrigating all forms of value into a single measurable proxy of free energy over unity.

*Tools to introduce here*

The essay puts forth a case that this measure is the perfect investment vehicle for reshaping the market landscape. In essence it asserts that we can harness speculation to divest humanity out of a debt based economic system into a thriving regenerative ecology. Attempts to extract value from this transformative system will ultimatly result in postive externalities and realise locked potential. It is therefore an antifragile market mechanism that cannot be captured by the extractive nature of capitalism.

## Market Hypothesis
Before we jump into solutions - which are often unfalsifiable value assertions - we must first examine and expound our a priori assumptions about the financial system. By negating these we may see what emerges to become self-evident; only then might we deem a solution adequite. Before such let's first look at market participants and the trends that move them.

#### Participants
> - Alpha investors; risk-on. Seeks return on investment.
> - Beta investors; risk-off. Seeks wealth preservation.

Our first assumption is that there are two broad sets of market participants that have different risk appetites. The first set are alpha investors and the second beta investors. The former have a high risk appetite and the latter a low risk appetite. One set of participants seeks to beat the market and the other seeks to 'be' the market. 

In order to animate these actors; let's characterise our alpha investors as hedge funds and our beta investors as pension funds. We notice that the former is incentivised by carrots in the form of profit, while the latter does it's best to avoid the stick of regulation and corporate responsibility. These core interestes of cost / risk / benefit drive market activity. 

#### Trends
A second assumption is that there are $5T of stranded assets that are traded on Wall St. books. These assets take mutliple forms but most generally speaking they are degenerative commodities like fossil fuels that are stuck below ground. If these resources are extracted the outcome will lead to planetary rent dissipation. Consequentially they must stay there.

Such commodities have no intrinsic value and will soon need to be 'struck off' the books. In this case we note that there is a minimum of $5T in market capital that is in need of urgent divestment as such assets must be abandoned with no place to go. Seemingly both forms of investors are in search of new 'values' as they begin to embrace qualitive indicators like ESG's as a means. One might say this is charateristic of society at large. 

As always, there is a deal of controversy about the efficacy of such values but both parties are essentially stuck in a position where they need new investment vehicles that are both ethical and profitable; ESG's will suffice as a general huristic with degrees of traction. However, what actually becomes evidant here is that investors have plenty of incentive to change and there is demand for high integrity vehicles facillitating the transition. Put simply both alpha and beta investors lack quality suppliers.

#### Economic Pathways
Provisioning appropriate divestment options will require the opening of new markets and a set of market makers that hold a completely different mentality from what we know and have seen before. Instead of externalising costs as entrapeneurs have done in the past, the demands upon the new breed of market makers will be to supply products that internalise values instead. For such financial products to be trusted, value chain auditability will be required.

Looking at economics in terms of nouns and verbs the internalisation of values are likely to take two primary forms; capital and curret-sees. Capital might be framed as a noun like wholes; as integrals that emerge from the aggrigation of many verb like interactions. To make these current-sees explicit, we need to track and measure the flows of a system across time and evaluate them against a baseline.  

Example measurements with the potential for aggrigation might include GIS data, bio-acoustics, nutritient density/brix values or qualitive surveys like communities or activity within a given ecosystem. These measures have little value on their own except as data so our concern becomes aggrigating these flows into a vehicle that our market participants will accept:

Beta investors, with their lower risk tolerance - will prefer the security of noun like instruments like co2 tonnes due to their lack of volitility. This is the easiest pathway to markets as a) the Natural Capital paradigm is already established, and b) because the design of such an instrument is more predictable and mechanistic than a product truely representing the health of a living ecosystem. 

Alpha investors will generally be unsatisfied by the simplicity of noun like products; they hunt volitility in order to realise potential into profit. This trait of potential actualisation is desirable for regen markets as it's a mechanism that can be harnessed. From an economic perspective lets simply ask ourselves; where is the most unrealised potential? The long tail of environmental, social and governance causes.  

Improving our ESG heuristic to a finer degree of resolution we can infer the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. The two former terms are social values and the latter two are governance oriented. Since we are relying on such heuristics  to financialise the regenerative activity of people and place (through the production of protocols) it becomes desirable for a vehicle to not only mitigate it's eco-socio-policical costs but to also generate and harmonise community values.  

Unlike facts, values are contentious and their discussion will generate volitility by driving change and transformation. As mentioned, this is a desirable trait for our alpha investors. The question becomes how they can harness this 




mitigating costs; risk and volitility will need to be baked into the design of any truely Regenerative financial product because its in the nature of both the markets and transformation itself. 

Now, recalling our investors are looking towards socio-political heuristics like ESGs - how can we harness markets to actualise the most unrealised potential according to their own critera?

# Technology


The key here is in valuing the verbs; flows and measures that are variable and dynamic in their nature. Keeping one eye on our goal of regenerative transformation we might direct the other half of our attention to proxy measures like organic biomass, bird song in the atmosphere, nutrient density of the crops and so forth. When we enumerate such values they take on such a hetrogeneity of forms that we find ourselves drowing in complexity. 
Consequentially there is need for a standardised ontology to integrate them all which is where distributed monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) becomes applicable.

> 2. sky-sensing (drones, aerial, sattelite) 
> 3. remote-sensing (IOT sensors & devices) 
> 4. reputation-sensing (Identity, community trust)








## Ontologies
Theoretically any form of measurement can be encapsulated by such a schema; be they qualitive social values or quantitive mechanistic values - it doesn't really matter as far as the schema is concerned. We might consider it a very low level 'API' interface. 

Still, just becase our measures have been articulated doesn't mean that they have been accounted for. To gain legitimacy in the traditional system these measures will need to be evaluated in conformance to exogonous parameters like the books of an accountant. At this point we probably need a higher level ontology thats instutionally recognised such as REA accounting. This enables the instutional evaluation of our dMRV measurements.

> 4. reputation-sensing (Identity, community trust)

We are nearly there; let's take in the view from this pleatau before carrying on up the mountain. We have a means to aggrigate measurements in the form of dMRV and we have a means to evaluate these measurements through REA accounting. The question that leads us to our mountains summit becomes; what do we evaluate our measurements against? 

With one eye still looking towards regeneration, we must consider what such a term actually means. This is undoubtedly a long metaphysical inquiry fraught with peril but let's skip writing a book on the Dramatic Universe for now and instead reference it to make an assertion; regeneration is free energy above unity - a form of harmony realised through the actualisation of potentials. 

Assuming such a statement is true, we can lean on active inferrencing (calculus) to evaluate the diversity of state measurements against a single unifying paramater. The numerical expression that arises can then function as a speculative asset; if harmony is produced over time then number goes up. If discord is produced over time then number goes down!

This market mechanism essentially provides a means to rate ESGs as well. Environmental, social and governance values can be evaluated against such a baseline. Any ontological preference set beyond this (such as DEIJs) can also be evaluated. The API is indifferent and consequentially any market that makes use of active inference to determine base lines is regenerative, unenclosable and anti-fragile. 

As this mechanism is an aggrigation over time it is subject to volitility and so fulfils hedge fund requirements for risk-on speculative markets. The more regenerative the credit the higher the profits in dollar amounts. The more profit is 'extracted' upstream the more wealth is internalised upstream. From an ethical point of view this channels energy and resources to its producers; proliteraiots and environmental stewards act as planetary generators.
