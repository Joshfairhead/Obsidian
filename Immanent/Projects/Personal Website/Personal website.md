## About me
Hello,

My names Josh. This site will hopefully help you to learn more about me from various persp3ctives. I'm hoping to convey both my essence and means of existance here. If the nature of your inquiry is professional, then existance is probably the starting point your after. This will unfold like a living curriculum vitae. 

For those looking for something more intimate, then the essence section is probably for you. Here you will find expressions of my thoughts, feelings and insights. 

Generally speaking, this site is a general manifestation of self, emerging through a combination of process and practice. It's an artefact of my workflow; so look around, explore and enjoy the design. 

### Essence
Immanent: Activities I do for pleasure. Interaction.
Omnicient: Knowlege; things I'm interested in or know about. Experience.
Trancendental: Creations born of what I do and know. Expressions

### Existance
Immanent: Processes
Omnicient:	Domains
Trancendental: Projects
