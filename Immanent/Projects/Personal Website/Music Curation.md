# Music Curation

## Introduction
This is a curated list of music that to degrees is reflective of my aesthetic and then inludes a few words as to why I like and enjoy the artist. On the surface it's varied but hopefully on a deeper level you will feel a sense of deeper pattern integrity. Welcome to my soul :p


## Bands
### King Crimson
As far as music is a reflection of it's creator, Robert Fripp is pretty much unparalleled in my view. The band made their debut in 1969 with the album "In the Court of The Crimson King" their most famous by a long shot. This is perhaps because of the splash it made when they stupefied the Rolling stones audience in Hyde Park leaving them so disoriented they didn't clap on the headliners. The album art is also pretty iconic at this point but since the 70s they have had many incarnations, reincarnations and continue blazing trails into the prog rock landscape. 

For many years I found "Red" the most appealing album as it feels particularly whole and exhibits some incredible compositions. The tracks "One More Red Nightmare" and "Starless" are, in my opinion, masterpieces. The album was also titled "Red" for a reason; the band broke so many formal rules that if you submitted such music to a music school exam you'd have received the report back full of red crosses. It breaks boundaries and sounds incredible having been recorded at Air Lyndhurst in London, the studio George Martin bought and refitted.

Another album really gripping and enchanting for me is "The Power to Believe", which displays quite some virility. It's a modern album with electronic instruments and bone crushing guitars (as well as some wonderful moments of release). The rythms, textures, compositions and technicality vital elements of their soundscape. You probably won't find anything like it anywhere else; incredibly creative and powerful stuff.

### Tool
When it comes to production values and musical composition Tool can bloody testify! The walk the same way as Crimson but blaze new trails. They are more deliberate and less improvisational. If Crimsons essence, Tool is existence.

The bands whole discography is strong in my view and the progression and growth from "AEnema" > "Lateralus" > "10,000 days" > "Fear Innoculum" is a beatiful example of what a really good bands maturation process looks like. 

The last two of these albums are particularly well crafted. Its incredibly hard to fault either of them on anything given their artful blending of odd time signatures, satisfiyng harmonic progressions, high fidelity recordings and beautiful art work. The sylabic math on Lateralus hints at the rearrangement of tracks on 10,000 days before Fear Innoculum unifies the sequence... granted, you have to be pretty esoteric to grasp this. 

Lyrically Maynard embodies his message directly in his vocal performance, with loud vunerability and transforming theatrics. Drums are as if Danny Carey is trying to summon Cthulu... or Mephistopheles. Adam Jones orders the harmony on guitars (often spacy fractals) and Justin Cancellor roots it all with some grounding low end. Its a living organism with vitality but Fripp and Maynard are still a combination I'd like to see. A Crimson, Tool crossover would be unbelievable so I guess its possible... if we go that far you might as well add Danny Carey as a fourth drummer! That would be summoning the beast for sure.

When it comes to picking songs for introductions "The Pot" and "Vicarious stand out lyrically on 10,000 days. On Fear Innoculum it's hard to pick favourites due to its strong valence and self-similarity; however for the sake of it I'm going to recommend "Decending" as a call into action that would be wise te heed.

## Fat Freddy's Drop
Oh yeah, this is some funky dubby souly understated psychedelic goodness. There are implicit landscapes between the lines on these albums. They are packed with meaning and significance if can you feel the soul? Of New Zealand origins, Fat Freddy's drop came out of an emergent convergence of Wellington based musicians. A label was formed, some gatherings held and a band formed organically.

### Sylvain Richards
Sylvain Richard (20Ssyl) is the multi-potentiate creator behind Hocus Pocus, C2C, 20syl, Alltta and a number of other artistic endevours. He's also a semi-pro skater and screen printer.

The flavour of C2C is pretty characteristic of Richards distinct style but as a team the group of turntabilists won the World DMC Championship enough times to get banned from competing. The tracks have a flavour of funky electronic disco and seems to satisfy most peoples tastes in a group gathering. It also consistently breaks the mould enough for those who desire texture, novelty and refinement in their music. 

Richards other stuff is solid too; most if not all of his productions feel sonically well polished and are often delivered with a simple but well designed and creative video. If you wanna dance you'll find that C2C and 20syl has enough rythmic elements churned with modern synthesis to warm up most crowds. If you prefer some qualitive hip hop; his outfit 'Alltta' with J.D. Mederios is worth checking out.

### Puscifer
Maynard again. The lyrics and vocal performances are as refined as ever but in particular "Conditions of My Parole" is a great album to start. I'd suggest having a sniff around as they are all pretty ideosyncratic in nature. #IamTheBriefcase

### Sturgill Simpson
Somehing super accesible you ask? Ok, well, Sturgil keeps things safe by keeping to familliar progressions and time signatures but he does a great job of making them interesting. He even seems to recognise and disclose the necessary recursivity of his writing in the lyrics of "All said and done":

> Keep staring at the pages, coming up with the same lines  
It's all been said and done by now, two or three times

Not suprising (as he knows how to weild the pen) because the line is also symbolic of essence of his breakthrough albums title called "Meta-modern Sounds in Country Music". Yep, psychedelic country music. You can't find a larger market than country music either so I believe so he nailed accessibility and wen't mainstream! Clearly Sturgil can steer his ship has found his edge.

Read between the liens. It's insinuated from the title "A Sailors Guide to Earth" that the albums intended to be a time capsule for a newborn child - probably his. It's consequentially a potent metaphoric reduction. In particular off that album I'll recommend the track "Brace For Impact" due to the particularly poetic lyrics paired with a particularly solid bass line chugging the title into life. The motown vibe throught this album also has an authenticity to it akin to the Muscle Shoals sound. If your a fan of the Danger Mouse sound (Black Keys), then you'll appreciate the production of this album in particular. 

The "Sound and Fury" album also exemplifies this form of production painting in the drums of "Best Clock Maker on Mars" which has a shuffle thats precise and unrelenting. The aesthetic of switching radio stations is quite creative too - it reminds me of Pink Floyds "Wish You Were Here". Once the blistering guitars get too intense (they do), your treated to these lovely moments of release like the tune "Make Art, Not Friends". I suggest sticking with the tension and listening to the album start to finish; it's conceptual.

### Kill it Kid
A short lived band from Bristol. The bands evolution went from bluesy folk to blisteringly hard rock over the course of three albums. Theres a clear tension of unrequiented love between the vocalists that seems to build to a breaking point by the third album (they later hooked up and continued as the outfit Iad Mae). 

Both singeres are very talented multi-instrumentalists. The guitar playing is authentic as hell and the keyboards have a practiced jazz influence to them. The rythm section are arguably just supporting these two but they do a great job and keeping things stylisticly appropriate. 

Each album feels complete in it's own right so it's perhaps best to think of each as phases of acceleration. They are each coherent in themselves and in sequence - it was consequentially most awesome to track their career in real time. 

If you want to know where to start "Feet Fall Heavy" exhibits the bands best writing across albums. Burned in the By & By was a nice Abby Road extra produced at their Zenith but sadly never on any album. Talented songwriting and very strong musicianship for the style.

### Snarky Puppy
Jazzy, with modern hip hop influences in the mix. Its cosmopolitian and well composed. Most of it's instrumental with a variety of soundscapes to explore. If your looking for something with vocals then start with the album Family Dinner. The tracks "Gone Under" and "Fire to Hot to Last" are the jewls from that gathering. Funky, sexy, erotic. If your more into the instrumental hip hop vibes then "We Like It Here" is a great album - plenty of exotic sun and colourful places to visit on that one.

### Pink Floyd
While I wouldn't call Floyd progressive anymore; they certainly were for their time. As a musician I'm particularly fond of Gilmores singing/writing/playing 
 (whole aesthetic) though Waters certainly produced some good stuff as well.  I'm not going to bother saying much on Floyd as many people will be somewhat familliar with them already.

### Ghost
Having seen the Ghost songwriter Tobias Forge on the covers of numerous music mags over the years I initially dismissed Ghost from the pantomine image. Having recently had music distribution channels force their new album Imperala down my throat I now realise the pure genius of this spectacle! 

Lyrics sung by front man "Papa Emeratis" the dark pope are a timeless tongue in cheek commentary of empires and the circularity of society and politics. The content is poetic, exceptionally perceptive and deeply significant. It speaks to the darkness of the marginalised as embodied in their music video called 'circle' below. 

All in all their discography is good. Theres some serious songwriting chops and deep craft with here. There are some more subtle easter eggs of Sabbath, Van Halen and Ozzy riffs if you listen into the arrangement as well - particularly on "watcher in the sky". If the these bands had a love child with Abba you'd get Ghost - damn this material is catchy.

## Albums
### Mighty Rearranger - Robert Plant
While a lot of Robert Plants work doesn't float my boat, Mighty rearranger is fantastic! "Another Tribe" starts the album and has a vitality to it that is as ennergising as a summers day. "Shine on" is another winner with its doubly layred chorus vocals and BIG echo effects, theres also a drum and bass remix of it as a hidden track at the end of the album thats pretty good too. This albums quite a landscape; I picture it as african for some reason - probably because of the odd time signatures.

Honourable mentions to the album Dreamland which is also pretty good; particularly the cover of Dylans "one more cup of coffee".

### Continuo - Avishi Cohen
An Israeli band consisting of double bass, drums and piano. The rythm section on this album is tight. The drummer especially wows me but the whole band are top of the range musicians. Once again the albums a journey, this time through the desert (to my ears) or through our emotional range. It has a bredth, depth and fluidity I've not heard on other jazz albums. Much of the time I find the genre hard to get along with; it's either too dissonant or polished. This album feels authentic in its nature. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/numSROD-gZY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Justice - Woman (World Wide)
Woman and its live remix Woman World Wide are both an incredible synthesis of synthesis... Their equipment is a sprawling array of analogue synths with an impressivly polished sound. The aesthetic is dark and light again. It's got hard raves and good times mixed with airy pop melodies that feel spacious. 

The production is great; if you feel into the embrace of Love SOS you'll hear a pitched siren that tracks the chords and washing white noise waves in the background. Everything on this album has its own distinct taste; if you have a wide musical palette you'll probably appreciate their tunes as well as a spring in your step. Oh and god damn, what a spectacle their shows were!

%% > French Electro / House artist who deeply inspired "†" I HIGHLY Recommend his album "Total" which you can find on youtube, and his "Ross Ross Ross" EP. If you just want to listen to a few songs, I'd say listen to "Embody", "Arabest", and "Ross Ross Ross". He also toured alongside Justice, Kavinsky, and Daft Punk in 2007. %%
