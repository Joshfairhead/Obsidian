# Grey Sky
**Intro - 8 Bars hold last chord for 6 count**
**Acoustic/Voice rehearsal: same but 4 bars**

**A - Verse 1**
- Grey Sky projects; expects turbulence,
Melody is braced to face harsh tonal winds,
Leaves are stripped; the sound splints into sonic chips,
An attitude absolute of pure remiss.

**A - Verse 2**
- Shifting sounds and sounds abound this hostile land,
Bush soul enraged but staved by a nimble plant,
unconscious waters orders legato commands
A division destitute of feelings found.

**B - Chorus 1**
- Shattered and shaken up,
Battered and feeling rough, but roots run deep,
Waking still waking up,
Bruises ain't a cut, but blues runs deep.

**A -Verse 3**
- Sapling roots and shoots grow fruits of many shapes,
This timbers limber; totems notes dip the shade,
Chorus answers; chances of a temporary awake,
No rigid resolute bends for its afraid.

**Intro reprise - 8 Bars hold last chord for 6 count**
**Acoustic/Voice rehearsal: same but 4 bars**

**A - Verse 4**
- Broken voice - destroyed - is poised to change its choice
A sense of pace the takes are paved to fill that void,
Seeded songs belong; long, strong roots in the soil
Superstitions written so relax and enjoy!
