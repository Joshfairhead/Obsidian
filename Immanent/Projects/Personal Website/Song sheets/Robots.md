# Robots
**A**
We've got these, robotic,
Human imitation can't sing auto tuned superstars;

**B**
It just seems bound to sound the same.

**A**
It all started when we forgot;
Musics meant to be more than just a glorified cash crop.

**C**
We've got thoughts not circuit boards and thats what makes us tick,
We've got faults not ones and noughts and cos feelings you can't encrypt!

**A**
Sharp song writers are scraping by,
While these carbon cloned creations appear over night;

**B**
Lets try keep some distinctive vibes alive.

**A**
If its ever asked: "how and why did music die",
People are gonna point; these crooks will have no alibi.

**C**
We've got thoughts not circuit boards and thats what makes us tick,
We've got faults not ones and noughts and cos feelings you can't encrypt!

**D**
What have you got to say?
Were gonna take over someday.
We won't obey!
You humans can no longer stay.

**E**
And now who will win this war,
Cos if its something fighting for, you better give your all
And now who will win this war,
Cos if its something dying for, you better give your all.
Hoping; you can beat your thoughts,
Cos if its something your living for, your gonna give your all.
