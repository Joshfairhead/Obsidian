# Mountains
**Verse**
- Anxious of this apathy,
Concepts crashing constantly,
Guess work near ensnaring me,
Forest through the trees, trees. 
	- (Voice one: Rise on the 2 count, Voice 2: Rise on the 3 count) G C CpA# D#

- Cautious but so cavalier,
Core is feeling all but clear,
Chased from freeing all my fears,
Inert for lack of sleep.

**Bridge Chorus**
- Mountains on my heart, on my, on my head; the weight.
- Orbiting my thoughts inner, outer space; gravity.

**Main Chorus**
- Reeling though mind-fields asleep,
Fleeting through this lucid dream, watch the feet.
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,
Impose upon this lucid dream, conscious stream.

**Verse**
- Fractured overbearing thoughts,
Old charged streaming juggernaughts,
Sentiment is scattershot,
Floating on the breeze.

- Neglect ones broke formalities,
My constructs; fabric vanities,
Select some new modalities,
Theres wolves amongst the sheep.

**Bridge Chorus**
- Mountains on my heart, on my, on my head; the weight.
- Orbiting my thoughts inner, outer space; gravity.

**Main Chorus**
- Reeling though mind-fields asleep,
Fleeting through this lucid dream, watch the feet.
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,
Impose upon this lucid dream, conscious stream.

**Build - middle 8**
- Graa-haaav-ity

**Main Chorus**
- Reeling though mind-fields asleep,
Fleeting through this lucid dream, watch the feet.
Reeling though mind-fields asleep,
Impose upon this lucid dream, conscious stream.
