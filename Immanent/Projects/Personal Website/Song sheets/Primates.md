# Primates

**A**
Our music at the roots; is time.
Conception of primal design.
Omini-present natural rhythms intertwine,
Sowing the seeds in our minds.

**B**
Father tempo, born on his own,
Constrained quatrz clock in a primate home

**C**
Humankind gathered outside, making sounds no ones ever heard before.
The noise comes from the beating drum and slowly; rhythm it becomes

**A**
Bright blazing textures ignite,
As timbre blooms from sines.
Broad branches then grow, and thrive
With music of different kinds.

**B**
A geniss of timbre the great unknown,
At the very roots of it she's musics soul.

**C**
Humankind gathered outside, making sounds no ones ever heard before.
The noise comes from the sound of horns and moving chords; something you can't ignore

**D**
Swing from the branches of melody grasps the polyphonic grip of harmony.
They call: eeeeeeeee, eeeeeeeee, eeeeeeeee.

**C**
Humankind gathered outside, making sounds no ones ever heard before.
The noise comes from the staked overtones; summing up yet another of natures mile stones
