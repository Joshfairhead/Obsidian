### Specifications as Constraints

Makes use of:
- [EcoCredit Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/ecocredit/), which allows for the management of ecological assets on Regen Ledger
- [Data Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/data/), which allows for the management of ecological data on Regen Ledger
- [Regen Registry](https://library.regen.network/v/regen-registry-program-guide/), which allows for the management of methodologies tied to EcoCredits
- [Regen Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/), which creates an accessible user interface to interact with EcoCredits

Coming soon:
- New [gov module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/03_messages.html#proposal-submission) capabilities (gov account can initiate any sdk.Msg)
- [Interchain accounts](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/apps/interchain-accounts/overview.html) support
- [Groups module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/group/) (on-chain multisigs)

Homebrew:
- Active Inference / Markov Blankets

### Design
**Call Specs:**
- Compensating stewards, Scientists, Bioregions

**Idea 1**
1) Bioregion
2) Stewards
3) Community institutions

- Bioregion / Community can have a bidirectional 'token' stream
- Stewards can hold context through the glass bead game

**Idea 2**
- Urban Regeneartion e.g. [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/gospelofchange/status/1602559757587456000?s=61&t=X-Qo1Tj-OIAkMgk8Nol0zw)
- Land ownership emissions; distributed ownership of a community land trust
