# Integrity Triad
Modal superset:

| 3 | 6 | 9 |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | Acceptance | Agency |

3: Awareness is an active state of perception
6: Acceptance is a passive state that allows for what we percieve
9: Agency is the coherent mental state that mediates perception with percieved

This reconciles with [[Emergent Cyclical Theory]] in that post subsistance levels can accept contradiction, controversy, conflict and confusion.
