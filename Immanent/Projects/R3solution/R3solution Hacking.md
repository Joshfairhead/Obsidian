## Ethics
It seems like we are drowning in a sea of noise, with signal scarce and scant but distraction everywhere. Big tech has colonised the internet and it's time that it was deterritorialised. While this vendor lock in may seem ok at first glance (they give us free tools), the game of capture and mind control through **prescriptive** symbol sets is antiethical to life. 

This library describes it's own form as a framework, leaving the door as open as possible to maximise it's affordances. It is general and **descriptive** but if one so chooses, they may apply it prescriptivly as it has many potential uses and implications.
