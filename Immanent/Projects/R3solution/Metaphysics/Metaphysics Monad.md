- **Physics** is the study of the interactions within a given domain.  
- **Metaphysics** is the study of the relationships between domains.

**Metaphysics** is an inquiry into the nature of the relation between self and reality. It is organized thinking that describes common aspects of the relations between self and reality.

**Physics** is organized thinking that attempts to explain the common correlated content of the perceptions of many selves in the context of a particular physical world.

- Physics (explanations) is an answer to a Why question.  
- Technology (prediction) is an answer to a How question.  
- Metaphysics is an answer to a What question.

In this same manner, it is also seen to be more correct to use the term 'interaction' when considering 'what happens between' self and reality, rather than just the static notion of 'relation'. As such, the concepts of objectivity and subjectivity are defined in terms of the relationship between self and reality, and that the notion of relationship is expanded to include the notions of 'interaction', 'perception', and 'expression'.
