# Capitalisms Trancendental Timemachine

[link](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4520/1/WRAP_THESIS_Greenspan_2000.pdf)

## Cost 
- Loooong and difficult paper. Cognitive capacity will be reduced over the reading period .

## Benefit 
- Should probably learn more about the CCRU, Rhizomatic writing, Schitzo analysis, and temporalities. This is some pretty foundational reading in particular underground cultures. 

## Risk
- Might accidently ingest some dark impressions and go mad... Or sane.... Hard to tell.
- Might not be a productive use of time.
