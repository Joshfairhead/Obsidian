Moved from a long period of reintegrating my felt sense of here, there, now, then, inner and outer worlds; I've been walking, reflecting and annealing. Throughout that process I've been listening to Hilltops Hoods; a set of friends traveling together over the many years. The struggles of their journey seems implicit in lyrical form; an outward expressions of their inner state.

Examining the dynamics of their production process through the iris' of general systematics and spiral dynamics seems to bring us to a quite mysterious insight regarding the dynamics of time and space; perhaps even the inner workings of the cosmos or historical 'state of affairs'.

Let's begin speaking functionally for now by examining the methods of their production process; diving into the lyrical content as a body section and then towards this cosmic insight for readers to ponder on. Sound good?

# Function: Production Process

For starters let's get acquainted with our performers; Suffa, Pressure and DJ Debris. This is a pretty synchronistic narrative to those triad in general systematics at least as far as the triad. 

For those unfamiliar with the group and their production process it's key to recognise that Suffa is the active agent of the band, pushing forward into the expanse, Pressure seems to passively chase his growth, and Debree cleans up the mess by acting as the mediating producer. This dynamic seems to express itself as a unitive fusion from the point when they released "State of the Art" but a dyadic differentiation seems to emerge throughout the groups progression in time.

Beyond state of the art; the band released a double album titled 'Drinking From the Sun' and 'Walking Under Stars'. It would seem that Debree was consumed in a car crash from lyrical analysis, and from there the two remaining MC's drifted apart but remained collaborators; taking it in turns to keep the Hilltop engine running. 

This seems primarily driven by Suffa, who's active energy characterises the first album 'Drinking from the Sun', with subjectively shaky contributions from Pressure in response. (Yellow pulling green)

The second album 'Walking Under Stars' seems to move into dialectic narratives, which feels saturated by Pressures heavier character and is at a guess polished in the studio by Suffa taking the reigns. (Yellow waiting for green dynamics)

Finishing with the song 'I'm a ghost I'm gone' by Pressure, it likely provoked Suffa to synthesise the two albums in a 'restrung' format to reconcile their rift. (Yellow growing into Turquoise transition, Green growing into yellow transition)

The final album which generated my mysterious insight is called 'the great expanse'. The distinction between the friends becomes increasingly sentient in the dynamics of their interactions which are characteristically fun, polite, open and honest - yet with a somewhat competitive edge from Pressure at the beginning that drives the two artists into a deeeep interaction that emerges collaborative between the friends but with a very tired pressure. (turquoise in the coral transition?)

Given both MC's representational capacity was crafted over their years of shared experience the tracks of these album are extremely rich, precise and expressive exchanges between very close but clearly separated friends. Why are bifurcation and schisms like these so hard to repair? have we 'slipped a cosmic disk'? 

From the authors empirical intuition and prior background in audio engineering, it feels as though total harmonic distortion between octave qualities might be a useful measure to understand dissonance in the spiral. The albums sequential nature also expresses a lot of qualitative information about dynamic states of being and their respective rates of ontological transformation. What repeating patterns are observable in their difference of perspective? 

Potentially fruitful areas of cross comparison seem like the difference in narrative arcs of 'walking under stars' and 'the great expanse'; which to my own perceptions feel like a repeating pattern of divergence, emergence, convergence. We might add further paramaters to increase resolution of our discussion but for now those three points are enough to map a full circle.

The eventual reconciliation at the end of 'the great expanse' however feels far wider apart in shared world view than on 'walking under stars'. Being able to measure the total harmonic distortion between ontological perspectives is potentially of much value towards narrowing divergences in our cosmic ecology. Is this indicative of a path towards slipping the cosmic disk back into place? What paramaters might we wish to adjust in our interactions to minimise distortion?
