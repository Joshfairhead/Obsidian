Last week has been something for me as the intensity of being human radiates a degree lighter. Symbols now outsourced to a page the veil of maya drops once again. No longer carrying the rock of knowledge I begin to move on to the bread of understanding. My emotions are volitile and I'm crying cathartically as I reflect on many beautiful people and moments. 

As my neurology changes it seems as though castles melt into the sea. There's a web of people for whom I have love but have been unable to show up for. 

I recognise the pain my unavailability must cause but in it realise the potential of regeneration, and how quickly the clock is ticking for us all. My financial situation is pretty terrible, theres hope, but I've not much fuel in the tank... fuck it, jump, optimise for the most imperative. Make light and radiate. Choose love not fear. Jump into the abyss. Protect. 

What to do? how to prioritise? there's only so much gas in the tank but love is imperative. Movements will need to be superfluid and highly optimised. Insights are pouring in. Drawing a circle in the center of my page I circle the term "love through annealing" and with it I scribble a cluster funk of a jazz ensamble onto the page that glows mono neon. How can I honour these humans? The clocks ticking, move. Make a plan. 

An enneagram emerges on the next page. Spiral colours and personality types around its edges. Yes there is synchronicity here.. I bring the material home to my partner and share the insights. Despite fears over the existential pressures we face, she is receptive of the sentiment and open hearted to the sensitive plan. Shes whelmed and steps outside. 

We have dinner and go for a walk beside the river while giving body to the torrential download. Arriving at Belem she softly leads me map my madness on the carved marble cartography. Who, when and where exactly? 

Anthony; my teacher becomes the imperative visit at this moment. Old friends and parents in Ireland second. It's becomes more fuzzy from there but theres a laundry list of loved ones to sort through. Geneva calls. Italy too. Do they converge in Austria? Fuuuuuuuk - Thailand, Arizona, Costa Rica, India, Romania then after? yes, it might have to ebb and flow but love will overcome! 

Ad astra, and onwards to the cosm0s!
