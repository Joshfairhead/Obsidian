Thursday: a shocking manifestation! Last minuite tickets to ReFi Spring kindly delivered by my good friend Ale at the Sovrign Nature Initiative who had to drop out last minuite. This turned out to be quite the adventure. 

Behind the scenes Ale had found the right point of contact and told me to ring through. "You better get your ass in gear, the train leaves soon" said the voice on the other end of the phone, "get to the station". Imperatives, I'm pretty used to these but thankfully the station was only about five minuites from my temporary accomidation so I had room to breathe. Jumping on the train I finished some work and shut the computer just as we pulled into the station.

A smattering of others had answered the same call and some enthusistiac energy awaited around the corner - secret agent Jessie was there to pick us up and bring us to the venue. I say secret agent as he was contributing from his own agency; the organisers only learnt of his contribution after the fact!

Jessie was the first Jedi I met but not the last. Others had also answered the calling; agents of spaceship earth playing positive sum games in order to dismantle the deathstar. Now that we had arrived it was time to find eachother through that shared connection. But how do you identify another Jedi? Sometimes you don't - they identify you; "Do you happen to know Laurence?" she asked while gifting her eye contact. 

YES! The week before I shared an intensly present experience improvising spoken word poetry or `cyphers` on regeneration with that mad man! "I used to be his flatmate" she said. Wordlessly we we're looking ahead to a plan, it was just all said in the language of gesture. 

The check in was fluid. Dinner remained fixed at 8pm time but the opening circle moved from 6pm to 10pm in order to accomidate arrivals. Time wasn't the usual binding agent you find at these places. The days we're structured enough for those that desired it, but loose enough to jump in and out of activities. Although I was a drifter surfing through on a friends ticket I was exceptionally well accomidated by the organisers and their hospitality who put me into a glamping tent with blankets. 

This kind of privilage is usually associated with status claims and nepotistic affiliations but at this point in time my identity was opaque and I was not imposing myself or title on anyone. This was simply open and unbiased inclusion. 

The opening circle was a well handled ceremony; the stewards introduced themselves and then conducted open space excersises designed to elucidate and manage potentialityby helping folks find eachother through what they called a 'prefile'. This information would go on a wall and gradually get augmented by offers/needs thorugh follow up excersises. Support pods were also formed by randomly grouping folks according their degrees of digital literacy. 

Post ceremony another Regenerati presented themselves; this time from the organising comittee. It was not a case of direct identification but indirect. This Jedi was playing the game too. They were staying present, listening to and metabolising darkness in order to raise group capacity.

The next day was tiring. Waking up early to help in the kitchen I was put on coffee duty, a pretty basic task but most appropriate for my worn state. The day continued though and with activity I began to wake up; there was a tightly structured set of participant presentations that I mostly ducked out of to tend to work but managed to catch a few. This constriction however led to a more vital evening. 

Those hanging up at the bar were the mycelial spillways. Unexpressed potential doing it's best to find pathways to shine. There was a lot of trauma awareness up here and good discussion on cybernetics, political activisim, hashtag markets, the stars and computer science. Given a party was inbound I took an early evening to recoup my energetics which paid off the next day as the canversations deepened.

BANG! Saturday arrived and with it new energy from the outside flowed in. New guests and participants bringing bringing vital and vivifying flows as the social system opened up to embrace them. The Jedi had arrived and brought with them the presentations of Syntropic agriculture and Monitoring, Veririfcation and Rewarding to prime the unconference workshops, pannels and X-Wings before flight. 

The feminine energy managing the kitchen chaos had adapted to the throughput and were in full flow; nutirous food distributed in healthy portions put fuel in the tank. The engines were replenished stewards of transformation took their position in the pilot seats. We were off to address the death star.

The unconference sprung to life in the form of improvised working groups identifying the fragments of conversations alive in the collective organism followed by pannel discussions to reign in focus  discussion. The self-selected pannels hosted inside had the flavour of an ordered stage, while the renegades jamming outside wrangled the more chaotic conversations into loosely coordinated splinter groups that would later lead the strategic integration during the party. Home made pizza was delivered on a regular candence refueling the pilots during the live music, DJs and saunas. Phew, another late one. 

The next morning Hans Solo arrived going by the name Ivan Sellers. A portugese steward that had actualised a community land trust. He graciously took the community through his endevours and the difficulties he had encountered in making his dreams real. The biggest hurdle he faced was reconciling his foundation owning the land, while assimilating free gaurdians that would do the work without being teathered to existing legal structures. Wow, Terra Agora - much Plato! 

Finally the Nebakanezer and Millenium Falcon arrived in the form of the OASA vision; a digital republic proposal to reconcile regenerative civics, hubs and DAOs at the inter-protocol level. This vehicle seemed intended to trancend and include all the various discussions and components of the event. 

The closing circle left me loving and feeling loosely loved by the participants whom I'd shared such a precious experience with. This higher octave signalled the end and new beginnings. ReFI DAO is about to take off. Exactly what form it takes is down to those involved. Who else will take this mission from cause through contingency to continuation? I don't know, but whoever does will be a considered a friend and commrade in much larger endevour than any of us expect. Space ship earth is primed for lift off - now we just need to figure out how the hell to steer!
