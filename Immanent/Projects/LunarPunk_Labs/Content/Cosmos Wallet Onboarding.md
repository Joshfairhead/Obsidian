# Wallet Onboarding
Hello, this tutorial is aimed at the complete beginner. It aims to get you setup and onboarded so you can benefit from the Regen ecosystem. We'll show you where to download what you need to get setup. 

### Getting a Wallet
There are a number of wallets you can use on Regen but the most accessible is way to get started is to download [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) - we'll work with that for now. Keplr is a [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser extension so you'll need to alread have that or download it first as a prerequisite. 

Steps for setting up:
- Download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Open Chrome
- Download  [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) (use this link)
- Click the blue "Add" button
- "Add Keplr" window will appear
- Click the button "add extension"
- In the top right of your Chrome browser beside the address bar you'll find an icon that looks like a puzzle piece; click it to see your Chrome extensions.
- A menu will appear and at the bottom is "Keplr", click it to start your wallet.
- Do NOT sign in with Google, instead click on "create new account"
- You'll see a list of 12 words; this is important to save for account recovery (copy them and store them safely)
- Name your account however you see fit; its just for reference
- Now create a pasword that you'll remember and store it safely (in a password manager if possible)
- Keplr will check you have stored your 12 words; click them in the requested order and select done
- The screen will close as you are now done with initial wallet setup


### Using the Wallet
Steps for use:
- In the top right of your Chrome browser beside the address bar you'll find an icon that looks like a puzzle piece; click it to see your Chrome extensions.
- A menu will appear and at the bottom is "Keplr", click it to open your wallet.
- Type your password into Keplr and click "unlock"
- At the top of the Keplr window between the hamburger menu and the icon of a person you'll see a network name - probably "cosmos hub"
- Click this for a drop down menu and scroll down to find "Regen" and select it as your network
- "Cosmos hub" will now read "Regen" instead
- A little below you'll see a set of characters like "regen1pc6x4v4sxlf...05cy3tt4w", this is your wallet address
- Click it to copy your address (you'll see a notification of "address copied")
- You can share this with others and they will be able to send you tokens. 
- Ask a friend to send you a test transaction of a small amount just to make sure everythings working
- You can check these have been recieved by opening Keplr and looking at the purple "avalable" tag
- You can earn comission on any tokens you own by clicking the purple "stake" button; this is more complex please see the references section for a Staking tutorial

### enDAOment 
- Follow the above setup instructions but don't add tokens to your wallet, the address needs to be unused.
- Copy the address and send it to your buddy at the Regen Foundation
- We will convert it into a locked wallet and send you tokens for staking
- Once recieved, follow the [Staking Regen Tutorial](https://regen-network.medium.com/staking-with-keplr-dc8cdfda0cc7)
