## Abstract
Markets forces can be thought of as a set of determining conditions within material reality. The aggrigated whole of these macro economic mechanisms incentivise the evolution of science and technology by channeling the pathways of research and implementation. Though biased through such incentives, we might consider markets to be an existential steering wheel of tremendous transformative capacity. The essential question quickly becomes how to work with it rather than against it? 

Any answer at this point becomes a values assertion but for the purposes of our inquiry let's articulate an asiprational north star of regeneration and bound it to a domain of processes that harmonise people with place. These processes when turned into protocols might be considered regenerative financial instruments. The question then becomes how to represent and evaluate such protocols in a way that meets the markets demand?

## Market Hypothesis
Before designing such a financial technology, let's articulate some working assumptions about the market in order to progressivly approximate some enabling constraints. Lets start with the major market participants and then examine the forces which move them.

#### Participants (What)
> - Alpha investors; risk-on. Seeks return on investment. Quantifiers.
> - Beta investors; risk-off. Seeks wealth preservation. Qualifiers.

Our first assumption is that there are two broad sets of market participants that have different risk appetites. The first set participants are alpha investors and the second set are beta investors. The former have a high risk appetite and the latter a low risk appetite; one set seeks to beat the market and the other desires to 'be' the market. 

Animating these actors, let's characterise our alpha investors as hedge funds and our beta investors as pension funds. Here we notice that the former is incentivised by carrots in the form of returns, while the latter does it's best to avoid the stick of regulation and corporate responsibility. Note that costs / risks / benefits moves both sets of participants at a pretty fundemental level. Mediating this are the blue funds that open up markets for both parties.

#### Institutional Constraints (Why)
The next assumption about markets is that there are $5T of stranded assets that are traded on Wall St. books. These degenerative assets take mutliple forms but generally speaking they are below ground commodities like coal, oil and gas, which can't be extracted due to planetary boundary conditions. As these commodities have no intrinsic value their existance essentially depends on an irrational market and soon these assets will need to be 'struck from the books'.  

Consequentially, both investor profiles are searching for new stores of value; a phenomena observable through their embrace of qualitive indicators such as ESGs. As always, there is a deal of controversy about the efficacy of these specific symbols and though imperfect in themselves ESG's have sufficient traction to suffice as a general set of values that help make intervention points more evidant.

Regardless of the specific heuristic, it's apparent that both of our investor profiles are caught in a dilemmea of reconciling qualitive values with quantitive measures. They have plenty of motivation to divest their capital but they lack profitable investment vehicals that can account for a given set of values in a quantifiable manner. 

#### Economic Pathways (How)
Provisioning divestment options consequentially requires the opening of new markets and a set of market makers that hold a completely different mentality from what we know and have seen before. Instead of externalising costs, as entrapeneurs have done in the past, the demands upon the new breed of market makers will be to supply products that instead internalise and account for values. This is essentially a $5T market opportunity for blue funds capable of facilitating such a transfomation; the question is what kind of products would such a marketplace either need or want? 

Examining economics in terms of nouns and verbs helps us to distinguish capital from currencies. Currencies (current-seas) are measures of value across time; where as capital arises from a concentrated aggrigiation these flows. In that regard we see two forms of measure; the qualitive and quantitive which then require evaluation against a baseline in order to become a codified form of capital. 

From the quantitive perspective, input measurements with the potential for aggrigation might include GIS data, bio-acoustics, nutritient density or brix values ect. These measures are useful at the data level but they lack an interoperable standard and consequentially their organised arrangement at the information level becomes a concern. The qualitive perspective faces the same representation challenges except thier initial expressions are non-fungible instead; the devils in the implementation details!


The representation, organisation and translation of such values becomes a deep set of scientific and technical challenges where 

Beta investors, with their lower risk tolerance - will prefer the security of noun like instruments like co2 tonnes due to their lack of volitility. This is the easiest pathway to markets as a) the Natural Capital paradigm is already established, and b) because the design of such an instrument is more predictable and mechanistic than a product truely representing the health of a living ecosystem. 

Alpha investors will generally be unsatisfied by the simplicity of noun like products; they hunt volitility in order to realise potential into profit. This trait of potential actualisation is desirable for regen markets as it's a mechanism that can be harnessed. From an economic perspective lets simply ask ourselves; where is the most unrealised potential? The long tail of environmental, social and governance causes. 

##### Quality
Improving our ESG heuristic to a finer degree of resolution we can infer the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. The two former terms are social values and the latter two are governance oriented. Since we are relying on such heuristics  to financialise the activity of people and place through the production of protocols it becomes desirable for a regenerative vehicle to not only mitigate it's eco-socio-policical costs but to also generate and harmonise community values. 

Unlike facts, values are subject to contention and their discussion will often generate enough volitility to drive change and transformation. The more often they are measured the quicker certainty is gained. This harmonisation of values towards certainty can be measured as free energy above unity; which is also a single measure that can serve as an investable quantifier.

The key here is in valuing the verbs; flows and measures that are variable and dynamic in their nature. Keeping one eye on our goal of regenerative transformation we might direct the other half of our attention to proxy measures like organic biomass, bird song in the atmosphere, nutrient density of the crops and so forth. When we enumerate such values they take on such a hetrogeneity of forms that we find ourselves drowing in complexity. 
Consequentially there is need for a standardised ontology to integrate them all which is where distributed monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) becomes applicable.

## Ontologies
Theoretically any form of measurement can be encapsulated by such a schema; be they qualitive social values or quantitive mechanistic values - it doesn't really matter as far as the schema is concerned. We might consider it a very low level 'API' interface. 

Still, just becase our measures have been articulated doesn't mean that they have been accounted for. To gain legitimacy in the traditional system these measures will need to be evaluated in conformance to exogonous parameters like the books of an accountant. At this point we probably need a higher level ontology thats instutionally recognised such as REA accounting. This enables the instutional evaluation of our dMRV measurements.

> 2. sky-sensing (drones, aerial, sattelite) 
> 3. remote-sensing (IOT sensors & devices) 
> 4. reputation-sensing (Identity, community trust)

We are nearly there; let's take in the view from this pleatau before carrying on up the mountain. We have a means to aggrigate measurements in the form of dMRV and we have a means to evaluate these measurements through REA accounting. The question that leads us to our mountains summit becomes; what do we evaluate our measurements against? 

With one eye still looking towards regeneration, we must consider what such a term actually means. This is undoubtedly a long metaphysical inquiry fraught with peril but let's skip writing a book on the Dramatic Universe for now and instead reference it to make an assertion; regeneration is free energy above unity - a form of harmony realised through the actualisation of potentials. 

Assuming such a statement is true, we can lean on active inferrencing (calculus) to evaluate the diversity of state measurements against a single unifying paramater. The numerical expression that arises can then function as a speculative asset; if harmony is produced over time then number goes up. If discord is produced over time then number goes down!

This market mechanism essentially provides a means to rate ESGs as well. Environmental, social and governance values can be evaluated against such a baseline. Any ontological preference set beyond this (such as DEIJs) can also be evaluated. The API is indifferent and consequentially any market that makes use of active inference to determine base lines is regenerative, unenclosable and anti-fragile. 

As this mechanism is an aggrigation over time it is subject to volitility and so fulfils hedge fund requirements for risk-on speculative markets. The more regenerative the credit the higher the profits in dollar amounts. The more profit is 'extracted' upstream the more wealth is internalised upstream. From an ethical point of view this channels energy and resources to its producers; proliteraiots and environmental stewards act as planetary generators.

This is an innovation chasm ripe for blue funds who wish to bridge the transition by making use of scientific and technological means.

#### Introduction
We now have a lever. Regenerative investment vehicals essentially represent the transformation of financial capital from a quantifier that externalises its costs into one that interanlises values. We will achieve this by converting markets from an existential liability into our greatest regenerative asset by aggrigating all forms of value into a single measurable proxy of free energy over unity.

*Tools to introduce here*

The essay puts forth a case that this measure is the perfect investment vehicle for reshaping the market landscape. In essence it asserts that we can harness speculation to divest humanity out of a debt based economic system into a thriving regenerative ecology. Attempts to extract value from this transformative system will ultimatly result in postive externalities and realise locked potential. It is therefore an antifragile market mechanism that cannot be captured by the extractive nature of capitalism.
