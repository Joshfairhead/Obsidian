## Abstract
Markets forces can be thought of as a set of determining conditions within material reality. The aggrigated whole of these macro economic mechanisms incentivise the evolution of science and technology by channeling the pathways of research and implementation. Though biased through such incentives, we might consider markets to be an existential steering wheel of tremendous transformative capacity. The essential question quickly becomes how to work with it rather than against it? 

Any answer at this point becomes a values assertion but for the purposes of our inquiry let's articulate an asiprational north star of regeneration and bound it to a domain of processes that harmonise people with place. These processes when turned into protocols might be considered regenerative financial instruments. The question then becomes how to represent and evaluate such protocols in a way that meets the markets demand?

## Market Hypothesis
Before innovating on such financial technology, let's articulate some working assumptions about the market in order to progressivly approximate some enabling constraints. Let's start with the major market participants and then examine the forces which move them.

#### Participants (Who)
> - Alpha investors; risk-on. Seeks return on investment. Quantifiers.
> - Beta investors; risk-off. Seeks wealth preservation. Qualifiers.

Our first assumption is that there are two broad sets of market participants that have different risk appetites. The first set of participants are alpha investors and the second set are beta investors. The former have a high risk appetite and the latter a low risk appetite; one set seeks to beat the market and the other desires to 'be' the market. 

Animating these actors, let's characterise our alpha investors as hedge funds and our beta investors as pension funds. Here we notice that the former is incentivised by carrots in the form of returns, while the latter does it's best to avoid the stick of regulation and corporate responsibility. Note that costs / risks / benefits moves both sets of participants at a pretty fundemental level. Blue funds mediate this by opening up new markets for both appetites.

#### Institutional Constraints (Why)
The next assumption about markets is that there are $5T of stranded assets that are traded on Wall St. books. These assets take mutliple forms but generally speaking they are below ground commodities like coal, oil and gas, which can't be extracted due to planetary boundary conditions. As these commodities have no intrinsic value their existance essentially depends on an irrational market; when it sobers up these assets will need to be 'struck from the books'.  

Both investor profiles are consequentially searching for new stores of value; a phenomena observable through their embrace of qualitive indicators such as ESGs. As always, there is a deal of controversy about the efficacy of these specific values and though imperfect in themselves ESG's have sufficient traction to suffice as a general set of heuristics that help make intervention points more evidant.

Regardless of the specific values, it's apparent that both of our investor profiles are caught in a dilemmea of reconciling qualitive values with quantitive measures. Market participants have plenty of motivation to divest their capital but they lack profitable investment vehicals that can account for a given set of values in a quantifiable manner. 

#### Economic Pathways (How)
Provisioning divestment options consequentially requires the opening of new markets and a set of market makers that hold a completely different mentality from what we know and have seen before. Instead of externalising costs, as entrapeneurs have done in the past, the demands upon the new breed of market makers will be to supply products that instead internalise and account for values. This is essentially a $5T market opportunity for blue funds capable of facilitating such a transfomation; the question is what kind of products would such a marketplace either need or want? 

Examining economics in terms of nouns and verbs helps us to distinguish **capital** from **currencies**. Currencies (current-seas) are measures of value flow across time, whereas capital arises from integrating these flows. In that regard we see two forms of measure; the qualitive and quantitive.

From the quantitive perspective, input measurements with the potential for aggrigation might include GIS data, bio-acoustics, nutritient density or brix values ect. These measures are useful at the data level but aggrigating them becomes difficult due to a lack of interoperable standards and consequentially their organised arrangement at the information level becomes a concern. This is also an issue for the qualitive accounting of heuristics like ESGs. The representation, organisation and translation of such values has become a scientific and technical challenge is only now becoming solvible. 

When it comes to these scientific and technological realms, Markov / Friston blankets help in this matter by providing a means to bound unweildy complexity into something more managable. These serve as a base medium from which higher order systems can be assembled. This means we can now aggrigate data streams into information classes and further build more structured and systematic relationships.

Going back to our investor profiles, beta investors are generally happy with simplistic noun like instruments such as commodities due to their static (low risk) nature. Alpha investors on the other hand are seeking verb like volitility and consequentially look towards more complex speculative instruments in the persuit of asymetric returns. This is where 'living capital' starts to become an interesting pathway. 

#### Living capital (What)
Paradigms like natural capital accounting and payments for ecosystem services have had a rough start and tended towards controversy because much of lifes value is implicit in it's healthy function. This complex behaviour is extreamly hard to package into a product, so we might more easily bootstrap new markets from legacy paradigms. From carbon, to cobenefits... to living capital. 

For the time being its easiest to codify noun like products for the institutional short head, as is the current state of regenerative finance with its carbon orientation. However, moving beyond such blunt instruments we can begin to augment these commodities with co-benefits in order to eventually compose new instruments through the aggrigation of cobenefits. This future however requires composible schemas.

For example, if the ESG heuristics (or SDGs ect) are considered to be our markets aspirational values, we still need to measure, account for and evaluate progress towards them. Such a substrate would enable the representation of complex and adaptive capital. For vehicles like these to arise however woluld require the composability of several interoperating standards: 

- Ground: Sensing Data (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification)
- Ideal: Evaluation criterea (e.g Environmental, Social, Governance)
- Instrumental: Blockchain accounting (Resource, Event, Agent) 
- Directive: Community culture (Agents, Languages, Perspectives)

To represent these standards in a composible way themselves, we can look back to markov blankets as a form of binding agent that allows for nesting at various levels of scale. The above represents a core feature set. Significantly, these blankets can give rise to a number of conceptual primitives around impact markets; namely conversation graphs that can represent certifications or evaluation criterea, while they are also relevant as an API layer for loading arbitrary input schemas (from sensors or other interfaces).

- Resource: Sensing / sensors
- Facts: Impact certificates
- Significance: Markov blankets
- Values: Impact evaluators
- Purpose: Stewardship impact markets

This kind of archetecture is general enough to be instantiated for any given application; be it simple commodities or a chain of complex systems. In this manner we can consider markov blankets to be a form of interface that enables arbitrary input data to be composed, accounted for, certified and evaluated. As the system is evaluating against a set of values there is a delta between

Beta investors, with their lower risk tolerance - will prefer the security of noun like instruments like co2 tonnes due to their lack of volitility. This is the easiest pathway to markets as a) the Natural Capital paradigm is already established, and b) because the design of such an instrument is more predictable and mechanistic than a product truely representing the health of a living ecosystem. 

Alpha investors will generally be unsatisfied by the simplicity of noun like products; they hunt volitility in order to realise potential into profit. This trait of potential actualisation is desirable for regen markets as it's a mechanism that can be harnessed. From an economic perspective lets simply ask ourselves; where is the most unrealised potential? The long tail of environmental, social and governance causes. 

#### Quality
Improving our ESG heuristic to a finer degree of resolution we can infer the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. The two former terms are social values and the latter two are governance oriented. Since we are relying on such heuristics  to financialise the activity of people and place through the production of protocols it becomes desirable for a regenerative vehicle to not only mitigate it's eco-socio-policical costs but to also generate and harmonise community values. 

Unlike facts, values are subject to contention and their discussion will often generate enough volitility to drive change and transformation. The more often they are measured the quicker certainty is gained. This harmonisation of values towards certainty can be measured as free energy above unity; which is also a single measure that can serve as an investable quantifier.

# Technology


The key here is in valuing the verbs; flows and measures that are variable and dynamic in their nature. Keeping one eye on our goal of regenerative transformation we might direct the other half of our attention to proxy measures like organic biomass, bird song in the atmosphere, nutrient density of the crops and so forth. When we enumerate such values they take on such a hetrogeneity of forms that we find ourselves drowing in complexity. 
Consequentially there is need for a standardised ontology to integrate them all which is where distributed monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) becomes applicable.

## Ontologies
Theoretically any form of measurement can be encapsulated by such a schema; be they qualitive social values or quantitive mechanistic values - it doesn't really matter as far as the schema is concerned. We might consider it a very low level 'API' interface. 

Still, just becase our measures have been articulated doesn't mean that they have been accounted for. To gain legitimacy in the traditional system these measures will need to be evaluated in conformance to exogonous parameters like the books of an accountant. At this point we probably need a higher level ontology thats instutionally recognised such as REA accounting. This enables the instutional evaluation of our dMRV measurements.

> 2. sky-sensing (drones, aerial, sattelite) 
> 3. remote-sensing (IOT sensors & devices) 
> 4. reputation-sensing (Identity, community trust)

We are nearly there; let's take in the view from this pleatau before carrying on up the mountain. We have a means to aggrigate measurements in the form of dMRV and we have a means to evaluate these measurements through REA accounting. The question that leads us to our mountains summit becomes; what do we evaluate our measurements against? 

With one eye still looking towards regeneration, we must consider what such a term actually means. This is undoubtedly a long metaphysical inquiry fraught with peril but let's skip writing a book on the Dramatic Universe for now and instead reference it to make an assertion; regeneration is free energy above unity - a form of harmony realised through the actualisation of potentials. 

Assuming such a statement is true, we can lean on active inferrencing (calculus) to evaluate the diversity of state measurements against a single unifying paramater. The numerical expression that arises can then function as a speculative asset; if harmony is produced over time then number goes up. If discord is produced over time then number goes down!

This market mechanism essentially provides a means to rate ESGs as well. Environmental, social and governance values can be evaluated against such a baseline. Any ontological preference set beyond this (such as DEIJs) can also be evaluated. The API is indifferent and consequentially any market that makes use of active inference to determine base lines is regenerative, unenclosable and anti-fragile. 

As this mechanism is an aggrigation over time it is subject to volitility and so fulfils hedge fund requirements for risk-on speculative markets. The more regenerative the credit the higher the profits in dollar amounts. The more profit is 'extracted' upstream the more wealth is internalised upstream. From an ethical point of view this channels energy and resources to its producers; proliteraiots and environmental stewards act as planetary generators.

This is an innovation chasm ripe for blue funds who wish to bridge the transition by making use of scientific and technological means.

#### Introduction
We now have a lever. Regenerative investment vehicals essentially represent the transformation of financial capital from a quantifier that externalises its costs into one that interanlises values. We will achieve this by converting markets from an existential liability into our greatest regenerative asset by aggrigating all forms of value into a single measurable proxy of free energy over unity.

*Tools to introduce here*

The essay puts forth a case that this measure is the perfect investment vehicle for reshaping the market landscape. In essence it asserts that we can harness speculation to divest humanity out of a debt based economic system into a thriving regenerative ecology. Attempts to extract value from this transformative system will ultimatly result in postive externalities and realise locked potential. It is therefore an antifragile market mechanism that cannot be captured by the extractive nature of capitalism.
