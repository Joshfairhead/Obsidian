# THE MONAD
**Universe of Inquiry (UOI)**: MAKE NOTES IN RESPONSE TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
- What are you curious about that seems to be pointing to the possibility of new knowledge or and fresh interpretation?
	- Active Inference Technology, Friston Blankets, General Systematics
- What area of inquiry attracts you to take on a Ph.D.?
	- Computer science: Particularly architecting (and implementing) the semantic web. 
- Is there something that perplexes you that might be worth researching into?
	- What kind of infrastructural engineering is needed to successfully navigate the anthropocene?
- Is there a topic in your studies or experience so far where the explanations given feel very unsatisfactory?
	- Semantic Interoperability
	- Regenerative capital markets
	- "Generalised Hypercerts"

Review and reflect on your notes and identify a theme that you intuit could be a unifying focus for your research?
1) Write two or three words that summarise the possible focus and place in the centre of the Monad Diagram.
	- Adaptive capital
		- Semantically
		- Compossible
		- Adaptive
		- Modular
		- Perspectives
2) Pick out four or five ideas from the rest of your notes that seem closest to or enriching towards the unifying centre and note them in the first circle.
	- Active Inference
		- General Systematics
		- Friston blankets 
	- Blockchain 
		- "Hypercerts" 
		- "Impact Certificates"
		- "Impact Markets"
		- "Generalised Impact Evaluators"
	- Practice based methodologies
1) In the second circle add any that are possibly relevant but more marginal
	- Soverign Nature
		- Free Energy Principle
		- Conversation Graphs (CONSERVATION GRAPHS!)
		- Nature Based Solutions
	- Payment for Ecosystem Services
	- Resource, Event, Agent accounting
	- Eco-Credits
2) Outside the second circle note the ideas that, although of interest at the start of this exercise, are irrelevant, distracting or could be confusing to the main focus.
	- Physical internet
	- Digital Twins
	- MetaNFTs
	- Data Integrity
	- Bayesian Reasoning
	- dMRV
		- GIS / Sensors
		- Tracking

# THE DYAD
**Why research this universe of inquiry?** 
**The known / unknown boundary**: MAKE NOTES IN RESPONSE TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
-   What is the state of the known in this topic of inquiry?
	- Cybernetics
			- Augmented capabilities
				- Artificial intelligence
					- Active inference
						- Friston Blankets
							- Systematics
								- Distributed Hash Tables 
									- Content addressable storage
										- Digital Twins / Identities
-   What are the unknown areas of interest?
	- Environmental engineering
	- Sensors and interfaces
	- Free energy principal
	- Friston blankets
	- Conservation
	- Social values
	- Forms of capital / current-sees
	- Psycho history
-   What are the primary assumptions of the prevailing view of the topic?
	- Free energy principal can act as a unifying consilience.
	- Technology 
-   What are you questioning about those primary assumptions?
	- How does FEP work exactly and how do they get implemented as Friston blankets? 
	- What information feeds are needed for a Friston blanket interface to make inferences? 
-   What is interesting for its own sake in this topic?
	- The essential values of people, place and protocols 
	- Second order science, semantic technology, adaptive markets. 
	- Cybernetics, cognition and neurology, the Gaian system.
-   What is of interest in this topic from an external perspective?
	- Markets, science, technology
-   What idea that could be different is attracting you?
	- Fluid adaptive society.
	- Inner world, outer world fit.
	- Semantic web: Qualitative composibility and search.
	- Implementing Bennets Systematics for appropriate causes
	- Markov blankets are a general substrate for mapping complexity. Systematising them adds semantic relevance to compossible classes of nodes. Data structured in such a way enables the comparison, translation and evaluation of non-fungible assets. Capital markets are seeking divestment vehicles for oil and gas; let's make them adaptive to our planetary needs. Friston blankets and the free energy principle can ensure these new markets are adaptive to the flow of changing circumstances and programatically valued in proportion to real world fit. Truth claims about the world can be anchored on blockchains that maintain data integrity and transparency of methodologies used to produce capital. 
-   What are the forces that would reject that idea?
	- Those who dont understand it
	- Current market makers
	- Some market investors
	- Some regulators like the SEC and FCA
	- The network state :p

Review and reflect on your notes and identify the tension that is likely to energise the research unifying focus for your research.
1) Write notes in response to the contrasts identified in the pairs of questions
	- Making essential values viable through the existential means of markets, science and technology.
	- Technical vs Societal
	- Outer vs inner world interface
	- Viable vs vital
	- Machine vs Environment
	- Knowlege vs Understanding
	- Truth and Justice
3) Summarise them into one pair that feels like the impetus to make this a research field.
	- Fit and function
4) Headline the pair in the Dyad Diagram.
	- Adaptive commons
	- Augmenting reality

**What approach?** **Finding the Energising questions**: MAKE NOTES IN RESPONSE TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:

**AFFIRMATION**
