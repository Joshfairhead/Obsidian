# RFP Information

### Constraints
Nature Based Solutions:
> “actions to protect, regeneratively manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”.

Makes use of:
- [EcoCredit Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/ecocredit/), which allows for the management of ecological assets on Regen Ledger
- [Data Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/data/), which allows for the management of ecological data on Regen Ledger
- [Regen Registry](https://library.regen.network/v/regen-registry-program-guide/), which allows for the management of methodologies tied to EcoCredits
- [Regen Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/), which creates an accessible user interface to interact with EcoCredits

Coming soon:
- New [gov module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/03_messages.html#proposal-submission) capabilities (gov account can initiate any sdk.Msg)
- [Interchain accounts](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/apps/interchain-accounts/overview.html) support
- [Groups module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/group/) (on-chain multisigs)

### Design Suggestions:
- [Registry scope](https://library.regen.network/v/regen-registry-program-guide/regen-registry-overview/regen-registry-scope)
- Protocol-Owned EcoAsset Treasury
	- There are a number of questions to answer in this scenario: 1) what percentage of emissions? 2) what percentage of a batch? 3) what would be the eligibility criteria for credit classes? 4) would the chain intend to hold these assets indefinitely, or would there be instances where the protocol would sell some portion of this treasury? 5) how would permanence be factored into treasury reserve management (credits have a limited lifetime, established in their credit class).

# Proposal: "REGEN 2.0: Adaptive Capital "

## Background
To briefly preface this proposal submission with some context, the team at LunarPunk_Labs have been preoccupied with the realisation of the semantic web. We have previously won the digital identity track at the worlds largest hackathon and specialise in systematic frameworks. 

## Description of Tokenomic Mechanism
Adaptive Capital is a proposition for valuing living ecosystems through multi-perspective architecture and the free energy principal; a means of integrating quantitive measures with qualitative values. For such a project to find traction we need consider the existential domains of markets, science and technology. 

**Market Assumptions**
It's our belief that markets are seeking to divest themselves from degenerate commodities to more regenerative investment vehicles; they are however constrained by a lack appropriate pathways. We confidently assert this as it's known that there are $5T of "stranded assets" trading on Wall St. books, which in our opinion represents a transformation opportunity thats global in scale - provided we can address their pain points with integrity. [[Economics]]

**Scientific Assumptions**
There are two primordial forms of scientific reasoning; rational proof (deductive knowledge/Baconian) and empiric verification (inductive wisdom/Goethian). Regenerative science integrates both approaches to Truth through abductive reasoning based on known priors (Bayesian inferrence). It would seem that active inference augmented by general systematics are a hand and glove fit for this task.
