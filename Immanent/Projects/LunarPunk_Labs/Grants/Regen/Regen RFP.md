# Tokenomics Proposal: "Adaptive Capital "

## Background
To briefly preface this proposal submission with some background context; we are essentially proposing an ecosystem level partnership between Regen Network and Protocol Labs. This comes from our teams desire to the gap between research and implementation. 

The proposal below outlines the current state of our implementation plan and we are soliciting discussion and feedback for further advancement. There is plenty of scope for improvement, which we trust will happen as we advance our work. We believe that the proposal submitted to PL can help lay strong research foundations; while Regen is fertile soil for grounded technical implementation.

## Specifications
Regen Registry defines Nature Based Solutions in the following manner:

> Actions to protect, regeneratively manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”.

"Adaptive Capital" is subsequently a proposition for valuing living ecosystems through multi-perspective architecture and the free energy principal; a means of evaluating quantitive measures with qualitative outcomes. For such a project to find traction, we need to consider the existential domains of markets, science and technology; while holding in mind the essential values of people, planet and protocols. Let's explore our assumptions about these domains:

**Market Assumptions**
Markets are seeking pathways for divestment from degenerate commodities to more regenerative investment vehicles is getting wider traction. However the divestment is constrained by a lack of said pathways and it's estimated that there are $5T of "stranded assets" trading on Wall St. books. In our  opinion, this represents a transformation opportunity thats global in scale - provided we can address their pain points with integrity. [Here is a longer primer we wrote analysing the fundamentals around ecosystem economics](https://commonwealth.im/regen/discussion/9918-ecosystem-function-economics). 

**Scientific Assumptions**
When it comes to addressing the markets with integrity, we need to incorporate truth claims and anchor this context. The methods used and the claims made are important; [Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper) believed science was about the raw explanatory power and predictive capacity of a framework, while [Khun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn) thought of it as a community of practice. 

In our view both authors are correct; reason can thought of as rational proof (deductive knowledge utilising the Baconian methodology) and as empiric verification (inductive wisdom through the Goethian methodology). Consequentially ReSci movement might consider integrating both these fundamental approaches to making truth claims by leveraging abductive reasoning and Bayesian methods. These base predictions on known priors before feeding forward to infer likely outcomes. 

**Technological Assumptions**
From a practical standpoint the story of digital communication begins with [Claude Shannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) information theory; binary 1's and 0's that convey state. Beyond Shannon's fundamental theory of bits and bytes, there are new innovations that abstract his binary domain into a trinary lens of "agents, languages and perspectives" where agents, speaking their language of preference, express perspectives on 'Truth claims'. 

As a technical architecture, such a '[meta ontology](https://ad4m.dev/)' enables us to encode other frameworks as 'perspectives', and in particular we believe that encoding "general systematics" is a particularly powerful framework that can act as a functional backbone for clustering parameter groupings in a transparent way. 

Applied at the interface level these functional frameworks can be used to generate a consistent set of active inference models that enable the encoding of practice based methodologies, eco-credits, accounting methodologies, evaluation criteria, sensor networks APIs, DAOs and far beyond. Such architecture is particularly elegant as it enables semantic translation and ad hoc composibility for an apples to oranges comparison; quantitive measures to qualitative values.

---

## Infrastructure Design

Let's frame some high level abstractions that we can lean on in relation to our ends:
- (+) Qualitative values (Impact evaluators)
- (=) Markov blankets (Hypercerts)
- (-) Quantitive measures (Impact certificates)

Markov blankets act as a form of general substrate that can then be further systematised with **metadata** to enable semantic interoperability - this is a highly general medium that is analogus to merkle trees and hash graphs. In Regens case this technical infrastructure is represented by the data module.

An Impact certificate essentially articulates a given methodology in a machine readable format. These certificates represent a set of means, while evaluation criteria codified in a similar format can express values as ends. For example, when it comes to open science, there is a movement towards making papers more accessible by encoding them as 'conversation graphs'; this might be represented in a tetradic geometry with nodes representing:
- Directive: Source 
- Instruental: Question
- Ground: Claim
- Ideal: Proof. 

Extrapolating such a concept one step further it's easy enough to imagine a form of bespoke consulting where the content of any conversation can be functionally represented as geometries that support the processes of communal understanding. Here's an example in relation to a discussion and programming:

![](assets/systematicsPlugin.png)

When a conversation reaches consensus on credit class, methodology, DAO design, evaluation criteria etc. we can use the interface to easily store and anchor data on chain. Any subsequent discussion can be self managed by the community, easily updating their credit design parameters through such a simple interface. Supporting data and conversation can be aggregated as a form of adaptive capital and issued as eco-credits, democratising access to technology in a significant way. Such a process can even be [turned into art](https://sovereignnature.com/tracing-the-wild) or gamified to make the process fun and rewarding!

Below the interface level comes the functional specifications for chain integration. Using the [AD4M ontology](https://ad4m.dev/) we can integrate general systematics to describe a set of metadata standards. From there we can describe both the data module and eco-credit modules as 'languages' and 'perspectives' in order to make them interoperable with other architectures. For added precision, we may wish to add other ontologies for translating quantity (data module claims like MRV) to quality (eco-credit attestations like ESGs). 

One particularly useful ontology to integrate is Resource, Event, Agent accounting, which is an institutionally recognised standard for distributed supply chains. This might then use feeds from  Monitoring, Reporting and Verification technologies as evaluation criteria for impact certificates. The elegance of this design is that if these standards are changed or extended, they can be easily assimilated, updated or recomposed. 

For example we can extend the triadic geometry MRV to be a tetradic geometry for more detailed resolution. For example, the following was articulated by the dMeter community:
- Directive: Human-sensing (Personal data stores, phone images, self reported data)
- Instrumental: Remote-sensing (IOT sensors, devices)
- Ideal: Sky-sensing (satellite, drones, aerial)
- Ground: Reputation-sensing (identity, community trust) 

Ultimately whatever indicators are at desirable can be articulated through General Systematics and codified as Markov blankets to unlock the capabilities of semantic composition. These functional models can then be enriched with Active Inferencing to provide a more detailed depth of [resolution](https://github.com/Joshfairhead/Obsidian/blob/main/Immanent/Projects/R3solution/R3solution.md).

## Pilot Tokenomic Mechanism(s)

The design at the level of general infrastructure for composing any desirable credit design, which is dependent on the parametric groupings instantiated around a use case or pilot project. 

There are obviously a number of [great projects](http://purplepill.vision/) in the [Regen ecosystem](https://regennetwork.notion.site/Built-On-Regen-Network-c6266114116842e389258747454f9f07) that would stand to benefit from such composable designs and we're keen to partner based on DAO capacity. LunarPunk Labs has a preference is to work closely with our existing partners at Regenerating Sonora in order to build out a low risk pilot project. Conditions around them are exceptionally vital; they have LEHR gardens, a community centre with a blockchain learning desk and high school tech club working with Arudino sensors! 

#### Regenerating Sonora Use Case
- Starting from the LEHR gardens, we assess possibilities. 
- It's decided that the key step forward is to automate the gardens water timers. 
- A group of local high school students automate the timers using their Arduino kits. 
- Using the systematics interface, Arduino data feeds are selected as the input 'perspective'
- These are then allocated to a 'language' describing the storage mediums (e.g. Filecoin Green).
- As the students add other sensors to augment the garden timers new feedback loops arise. 
- These changes to the model are assessed using active inferencing; do the feedback loops suggest the gardens are growing better or worse with the new automation?

At some point in the future a soil scientist recommends measuring Brix values instead of the students best guess, and someone smart also suggests tracking pollinators. The students put in new sensors and update their eco-credits underlying methodology using the geometric interface. Active inference engines suggest that these changes are beneficial to the gardens in reference to a stipulated outcome of vegetation growth, which is then automatically published on chain as supporting data. Consequentially the credit gains value in the market and efforts are rewarded.

As the student group develops a reputation for making strong decisions around the growing LEHR gardens, it becomes apparent that this is an investment opportunity to market participants. The students reserve pool grows in value thanks to this speculative activity, and consequentially so have the funds to scale operations into new locations. Both investors and the wider Regenerative movement benefit!

But that's not all, the students realise that the LEHR gardens have been an anchor point around which the community practices have grown which has brought wellbeing and vibrancy to their community. They use the interface to codify their activities as a state model, which they use to augment their commodity model as co-benefits. This reveals the more implicit aspects of their work, which is typically invisible to the bottom line of profits. These indicators help guide ethical investors and corporate responsibility funds to their project. 

### Community Capital
An example methodology our students might use for codifying their co-benefits is the H3uni framework deployed on the current course "The art of creative collaboration". This particular practice based methodology groups eight sets of parameters under four framing conditions. 

**Framing conditions:**
- Directive: Process
- Instrumental: Method
- Ideal: Task
- Ground: Context

**Paramater Groupings:**
- Self awareness
- Empathetic appreciation
- Group dynamics
- Interactive skill
- Cognitive framing
- Visualisation skill
- Perceiving qualities
- Mental repatterining

This particular methodology is currently being demonstrated as both the H3uni course with video documentary evidence AND being discussed amongst our teams on WeCo.io as a weave (chains of 1min audio recordings / 140 character cards in a sequence). You can keep up with the teams progress [here](https://weco.io/p/3528).

LunarPunk_Labs have previously [won the digital identity track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHhzJpDTEMs) at the worlds largest ai & blockchain hackathon and specialise in systematic frameworks (aka functional ontologies). Since then our team has been focusing on the realisation of the semantic web.

Weco has been building an open social graph for several years and have developed "The Glass Bead Game" as an interface for a wisdom commons. The interface is designed as a social network with a modular plugin architecture. Their work to date has previously been funded by Eric Harris Brown of CEPTR notoriety.
