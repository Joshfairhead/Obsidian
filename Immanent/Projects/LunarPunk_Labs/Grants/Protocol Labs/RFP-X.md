1.  A well-formed statement of the research problem and the proposed solution
2.  Evidence that the applicant understands the current state of the art relevant to the research question. This may take the form of an annotated bibliography or a brief literature review. 
3.  A clear explanation of how the proposed research program relates to Protocol Labs' current research activities, and a description of the foreseen impact of the work.
4.  An outline of the research strategy to be employed in the project, including significant methods and tools, a timeline of key milestones with budgets and deliverables, and a statement of the expected objectives.
5. You may additionally wish to identify any of your current research collaborations that are particularly relevant to the proposed project.

# Title: Systematic Semantics 
LunarPunk_Labs and H3uni

# Problem and solution
- Provide a concise, well-formed statement of the research problem and your proposed solution.

Six laws framing:
1) Question: How do we increase relevance on the web? 
2) Situation: [Information technology is a mess](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/30/hospital_legacy_systems_recovery/) and [finding desirable results on the web is like searching for a needle in a Google whack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Gorman%27s_Googlewhack_Adventure). Standards emerge from traction. 
3) Insight: Semantic hypercerts for eco-credits; a trillion dollar market vertical.

# Related work
- Provide any background framing for the problem. Identify and summarise the state of the art relevant to your research question. Assume familiarity with the field but not deep familiarity with the specific problem.

The web has always been emergent and despite the fantastic history of computers, a lot has gone off the rails, been missed or forgotten. There have been multiple prophetic visions that are have yet come to pass; from Englebarts augmenting human intellect to Ted Nelsons project Xanadu and beyond. Object capabilities were forgotten for a long period of time in favour of permissions and access control lists and only now emerging in the form of cryptocurrencies. 

The web is still in the dark ages and needs illumination, yet standards are emergent and arise out of traction. The first assessment we need to make is   

Relevance is a matter of semantics; meaning in the context of values and purpose. 


# Relation to PL’s research activities
- Explain how the problem relates to Protocol Labs’ [open problems](https://github.com/protocol/research/blob/master/README.md) or [recent research activities](https://research.protocol.ai/publications/). We seldom fund proposals without a clear technical link to one of our [active research groups](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/), so please indicate the group or researcher(s) that you consider the closest to your work.
- Recent: [Generalised Impact Evaluators](https://research.protocol.ai/publications/generalized-impact-evaluators/)
- Group: [Network Goods](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/network-goods/), [CryptoEconLab](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/cryptoeconlab/).

# Impact
- Explain the impact your work will have, be it in fundamentally advancing the field and/or improving real-world users and applications.
- $5T in stranded assets, new market makers, compossible impact markets from eco-credits.  

# Research strategy
- Outline the research strategy to be employed in the project, including significant methods and tools
