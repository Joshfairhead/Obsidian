### Constraints
Nature Based Solutions:
> “actions to protect, regeneratively manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”.

Makes use of:
- [EcoCredit Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/ecocredit/), which allows for the management of ecological assets on Regen Ledger
- [Data Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/data/), which allows for the management of ecological data on Regen Ledger
- [Regen Registry](https://library.regen.network/v/regen-registry-program-guide/), which allows for the management of methodologies tied to EcoCredits
- [Regen Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/), which creates an accessible user interface to interact with EcoCredits

Coming soon:
- New [gov module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/03_messages.html#proposal-submission) capabilities (gov account can initiate any sdk.Msg)
- [Interchain accounts](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/apps/interchain-accounts/overview.html) support
- [Groups module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/group/) (on-chain multisigs)

### Design Suggestions:
- [Registry scope](https://library.regen.network/v/regen-registry-program-guide/regen-registry-overview/regen-registry-scope)
- Protocol-Owned EcoAsset Treasury
	- There are a number of questions to answer in this scenario: 1) what percentage of emissions? 2) what percentage of a batch? 3) what would be the eligibility criteria for credit classes? 4) would the chain intend to hold these assets indefinitely, or would there be instances where the protocol would sell some portion of this treasury? 5) how would permanence be factored into treasury reserve management (credits have a limited lifetime, established in their credit class).
- Insurance Pools
- Forward Contracts
- Compensating Scientific Contributors
- Compensating Indigeneous Land Stewardship, Bioregions, and Global South
- Liquid Staking

### Submissions should include:
-   Concise description of the tokenomic mechanism you would like to develop
-   Project roadmap
-   Overview of the team/organization/DAO
-   Proposed budget/compensation structure

### Regen Foundation funding paths:
-   A REGEN token grant
-   A Community Staking DAO grant (500k locked REGEN tokens) to fund the establishment of a Tokenomics DAO
-   A token delegation (of REGEN, or potentially of ATOM and OSMO as well)

### RND funding paths:
-   Token grants with 1 year lock up of up to 200k REGEN
-   $25k USD cash payment
-   Token delegations

# Proposal Hacking

### 1 Specifications / Constraints
Makes use of:
- [EcoCredit Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/ecocredit/), which allows for the management of ecological assets on Regen Ledger

- [Data Module](https://docs.regen.network/modules/data/), which allows for the management of ecological data on Regen Ledger
	- Conversation graphs about methodology
	- "MetaNFTs" Systematic / semantic links
- [Regen Registry](https://library.regen.network/v/regen-registry-program-guide/), which allows for the management of methodologies tied to EcoCredits
- [Regen Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/), which creates an accessible user interface to interact with EcoCredits

 Homebrewed additions:
- Active Inference / Markov Blankets
- Systematics / OualSystems / Fracts
- Integrates / informs / informed by [[RFP-X]]
- [Holonics](https://github.com/wecollective/wiki/blob/main/new-wiki/holonics.md)

### 2 Design
Interesting threads from RFP:
- Protocol-Owned EcoAsset Treasury
- Compensating Scientific Contributors

**Riff A:** 
1) Bioregion
2) Stewards
3) Community institutions

- Bioregion / Community can have a bidirectional 'token' stream
- Stewards can hold context through the glass bead game

**Riff B**
- Proof of regeneration and verification bundle
- Urban Regeneartion e.g. [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/gospelofchange/status/1602559757587456000?s=61&t=X-Qo1Tj-OIAkMgk8Nol0zw)
- Land ownership emissions; distributed ownership of a community land trust 

**Riff C**
- Social ecology credits, self similar structures 
- Proof of care, proof of regeneration,
- Metrics of social resonance on increasing scales; e.g. proof of meditation
- DisCo

**Riff D**
- Composable credit classes 

### 3 Pilot Projects
- Regenerating Sonora / Arudinos
- Jillian Hoveys PHD + Systematics
- Agroforestry: AgroforrestDAO / EthicHub
- BioChar: Kulshan Carbon Turst / Jesu 
- Verification Bundle

### 4 Product / Market / Management
- Concise description of the tokenomic mechanism you would like to develop
	- Semantically compossible eco-credits; Hypercerts constructed from Markov/Friston blankets to match and mediate impact certificates with impact evaluators using General Systematics.
