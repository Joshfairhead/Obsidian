	- Why?
	- Define, create, ideate on the critical ingredients for your brand to enable us to drive exponential growth â€“ buying and investing should be inevitable:
		- Category -> influences value  
		- Brand position expresses better, special, different, increcasing a mental, physical and digital availability (influncing through reference, remenants, recall). We do this through the MODs (doubt, desire, dissatisfaction)
		- Messaging & activation intercepts the buying moments and addresses pain with gain.
	- Segment, target, position
	- Customer, specifier, influencer
	- Your one thing
		- For **target audience**, ---- is the frame, that point of difference.
