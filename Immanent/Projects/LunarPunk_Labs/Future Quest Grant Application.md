### Quest Title 
- ReFinancial Innovation

#### Website / Link
- [Lunarpunklabs.org](http://lunarpunklabs.org/)

#### Organization Name
- LunarPunk_Labs

#### Category
- Place baced regenerative economies

#### Problem Description
In one or two sentences describe the problem.
- ReFi has carbon myopia. The value of regeneration is implicit; it's embodied in the qualities of a well functioning ecosystem. The bottleneck for place based regenerative economies is accounting for and evaluating qualities in a way that harmonizes with the quantified fiat economy. We need ReFinancial Innovation!

The accounting for and evaluation of those qualities is the bottlneck of place based regnenerative economies

#### Solution Description
In one or two sentences describe the solution
- Make qualitative values investable by aggregating feeds into Markov blankets to evaluate free energy using active inference; anything above unity (baseline) constitutes increasing harmony/regeneration. These complex forms of eco-asset can warp market mechanisms into positive sum games that value the regeneration of people and planet. 

#### Concept Description
In one or two sentences describe the quest to achieve said solution.
- The specific function of LunarPunk_Labs is to facilitate conversations into data structures that enable impact evaluation. We are acting as a market maker that codifies espoused values into Markov blankets for state modeling and active inferencing. The pipeline looks as follows: Convene projects > Demonstrate facilitation style > Sense making sessions for specific projects > Functional specifications articulated > Development hand off.
