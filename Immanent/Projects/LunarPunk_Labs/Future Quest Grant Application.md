# Submit a Quest Proposal

*Please describe the project. Add as much detail as needed for a clear picture, but keep this submission high level. Our team will reach out to iron out and refine details before it is shared with our community and approved for acceleration. If possible, attach a deck or other documentation.*

### Quest Title 
- ReFinancial Innovation

#### Website / Link
- [Lunarpunklabs.org](http://lunarpunklabs.org/)

#### Organization Name
- LunarPunk_Labs

#### Category
- Climate communications and education

#### Problem Description
In one or two sentences describe the problem.
- The efficacy of the ReFi movement is severly constrained by the politics of markets, science and technology. Effective intervention demands new sense-making capabilities that harmonise and integrate these multi-stakeholder landscapes; the challenge is governance which requires communicating with, and educating, the community about pragmatic intervention points that drive forward momentum in the refi space. 
- %% The value of regeneration is implicit; it's embodied in the qualities of a well functioning ecosystem. The accounting and evaluation of such implicit qualities has become a bottleneck for place based regenerative economies because they lack ways to engage with the wider economy. We need ReFinancial Innovation! %%

#### Solution Description
In one or two sentences describe the solution
- Semantic impact markets that channel stakeholder conversations from applied research towards the implementation of (re)composable semantic data structures on distributed ledger technology to unlock the regenerative potential of institutional grade investment vehicles by funneling finance upstream towards environmental stewardship (through an iterative process of progressive approximation aka measurable efficacy of key indicators like ESGs/SDGs).
- %% Make qualitative values investable by aggregating vernacular heuristics into Markov blankets for active inferencing and evaluation against the free energy principal; anything above unity (baseline) constitutes increasing harmony/regeneration. Such complex forms of eco-asset can warp market mechanisms into positive sum games that value the harmonisation of people and planet. %%

#### Concept Description
In one or two sentences describe the quest to achieve said solution.
- We are reconciling the components of a global techonology stack (DLT) through facilitation, communication and education as our core offering as we believe that coordinating informed collaboration is necessary to move the refi space beyond its numerous complexities in a harmonious way. In particular we are focused on the field of active inferencing and the use of community articulated markov blankets that enable multi-perspective methodology evaluation and eco-credit interoperability.
- %% The specific function of LunarPunk_Labs is to facilitate conversations into data structures that enable impact evaluation. We are acting as a market maker that codifies espoused values into Markov blankets for state modeling and active inferencing. Our pipeline looks as follows: Convene projects > Demonstrate facilitation style > Sense making sessions for specific projects > Articulating functional specifications for development > Development hand off. %%

#### Estimated CO2 (if known)
How much CO2e would the project remove/prevent from atmosphere when fully developed? (in tonnes/year, eg. 2.4Mt/year)
- Research suggests that such global DLT infrastructure should ideally target about 10Gt/year 

#### Stage
- Started but not funded

#### Current Team size
- 3 Core catalysts, numerous contributors and advisors.

#### Capital needs
How much capital do you need right now?
- $25k 

#### Talent needs (roles)
What open roles are you looking to fill right now?
- Event coordinators, product managers.

#### Talent needs (gigs)
What open gigs (bounties, projects, etc.) are you looking to fill right now?
- Grant writers

#### Leader Name
We require that you have one designated leader (eg. CEO)
- Josh Fairhead

#### Leader Email
