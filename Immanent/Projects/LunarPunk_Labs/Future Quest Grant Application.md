#### Problem Description
In one or two sentences describe the problem.
- Capital/Currency is a debt based communication channel that is so thin it externalises all costs. The more we prioritise currency as a quantitive evaluator the more extractive and degenerative the world consequentially becomes.

#### Solution Description
In one or two sentences describe the solution
- Make implicit qualitative values visible and investable by aggregating them into a Markov blanket and evaluate against free energy principal using active inference; anything above unity (baseline) constitutes increasing harmony/regeneration. This enables investment into complex 'assets' that implicitly revolve around credit, transforming market mechanisms into positive sum games.
