### Hey!  
  

### As a GR15 Grantee in the climate round, weâ€™re excited to invite you to participate in the S16 Alpha Round and help test the brand new Gitcoin protocol.  
  
This Alpha round will take place from January 17 - 31, 2023, and your participation will help shape the future of Gitcoin Grants.

### Due to the new technology and processes being tested, we will be running the Alpha Round in January with a smaller subset of existing Climate Solutions grantees. Specifically, weâ€™ve had to limit the number of individual projects to the top 40 Grantees based on the number of unique contributors in GR15. Unfortunately, your project wasnâ€™t in the top 40 spots but you can still be involved as a grantee.

  

### To include all of our GR15 Climate Grantees, we have created 10 Climate Solutions Bundles that group the remaining Grantees by project type. Contributors will be able to donate to the bundle as a whole and then the sum of contributions and matching funds will be equally split between all the projects within the specific bundle.

### You are being invited to participate in the: Verification Infra Bundle

### The projects in this bundle include: TaterDAO, ImpactNFTs: an on-chain resource for validating impact, Puzzle Planet, Digital Gaia, Scaling Nature Positive Credits through Digital MRV, POCA: Proof of Climate/Community Action, LunkLabs: Regenerative Science, SproutUp, Scale EverGreenCoin, ORGO, Earthbanc Protocol, Project Themistoklis, Buan.

### ![ðŸ“¢](blob:https://mail.proton.me/6d0c8acc-fcba-4973-8ddc-de9483ab7b79) Wait what's going on with the Gitcoin Grants protocol?

### Weâ€™ve officially retired the old Gitcoin grants platform and weâ€™re 100% focused on building and testing the new Gitcoin Grants Protocol. This is the next evolution of our journey toward optimal coordinationâ€”empowering communities to fund their shared needs by facilitating transparent, community-driven funding allocation made possible by blockchain tech.  
  

### [The grants protocol](https://t.sidekickopen04.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN7RLW58PDj-2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsNH0W1yqpMY4WJ22vW2zlZNz6PtkfRf197v5Y04?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3P4GXd3P28WZW43Rxp03FbmJbW1LDhHp4hF7-CW1GBcSW1GBb-fW3H3BpX3Xtn5dW43VrRr3K2VhWW4hMpgv3JF4bGW49hb-j3JF4hsW3zd-d_45TRgGW49HS231Gy7nMW1GBFzy1-Wp5kW1GKh0X4fM_38W4cKKZh43Tw4jW43mzsM3JF546W43X5KG43SHhhF1Q5kK4rnWr1&si=8000000023814022&pi=5afffe73-4821-421d-8bef-a15307817ee8) is a new way of distributing funds within a community. It is Gitcoinâ€™s vision for the future of funding: not a platform nor an isolated fund, but a protocol that any community can use anywhere in the world that connects resources, contributors, and ecosystems in the most optimal way possible.

### [Have a great day.](https://t.sidekickopen04.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN7RLW58PDj-2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsNH0W1yqpMY4WJ22vW2zlZNz6PtkfRf197v5Y04?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-4rCvX6W4hCVj23Fbt5SW4myB8V3QJdFtW45qdkY3drZ274TnWM1&si=8000000023814022&pi=5afffe73-4821-421d-8bef-a15307817ee8)
