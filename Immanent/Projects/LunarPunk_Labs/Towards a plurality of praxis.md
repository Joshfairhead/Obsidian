	- Accelerating transformation through middle out methodology development
	- Transformation comes from the long tail
	- Gatekeepers get in the way but have their place

The foundational proposition of this article is an assertion that scaling regenerative transformation is driven by long tail dynamics. The incumbent gatekeepers of academia, goverment and big industry sadly tend to stand in opposition to this demographic; while they conserve the best of what is these inflexible leviathians block many of pathways towards the best of what ought-to-be. 

Put crudely, these leviathians simply lack the capacity to see, sense and respond to the small things that make the biggest difference. To this end Lunar Punk Labs seeks to catalyse and drive transformation in the domains of protocols, people and planet. 

At a high level, this article describes our plans to accelerate transformation with real impact through middle out methodology development.

## Body
- Tell them
	- Accelerating transformation through middle out methodology development
	- Transformation comes from the long tail
	- Gatekeepers get in the way but have their place


#### Governance
Our group is pretty small, yet we seek to perturb large scale transformation; as expressed we are attempting this by tending to the long tail and our organisation structure reflects this. If we're to escape recreating the hedgemony our macro structure needs to be hetrarchial. We're just humans going about the work that we are best suited to addressing; this is the notion of justice. 

As mentioned previously the short head of goverment, acedemia and big industry are ill suited to addressing global problems due to hireacrhical demands for legibility and over simplification. The real world is mysterious, messy and monsterously chaotic; its clear that local actors are best situated for solving local problems and so from the long tail we seek to generate ordo ab chao. 

With that said it's not just about bottom up emergent practices, we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater; the short head of instutional gatekeepers exist for a reason, which is to maintain the best of what is - even if it's in accessible to the majority of the uninitiated, their economies of scale centralises resources that are ripe for appropriation. In the case of acedemia these resources are domain specific experts and the cumulitive research. This view from the top down is valuable; the research wouldn't be kept behind paywalls otherwise!

#### Social
At this point your probably starting to infer what is alluded to when we say we are taking a middle out approach but let's make it explicit. We aim to pair long tail projects that practice environmental stewardship (aka the bottom up) with the short heads resourcing (aka top down's) of expert advice and scientific research. This is a generative middle out pairing.

How do we do this though? Despite the many long tail projects in existence we still have a gate keeper dilemma to navigate. By and large the market demand for eco-credits are driven by goverment legislation around corporate responsibility. This demand essentially prefigures the mentality of suppliers and in turn the issuers of eco-credits must typically accord to constraints that are far too monolithic, stringent and expensive for many small holders to desire involvement. 

These enviromental stewards are however the answer. Upstream is where the value is produced and down stream is where the funding comes from. We need new markets.

#### Environmental
Thankfully times have changed in recent years. ESG's are becoming a thing - but whos adopting them and why? This is actually a pretty simple question; the money markets are. There are $5T dollars floating around on Wall St. books that need of divestment from below ground 'stranded assets' (that cannot be extracted due to enviromental tipping points) into something else. The Wall St. cash cow of fossil fuel is no longer profitible and they know it; it's just a matter of time until the irrational market sobers up. 

We have risk on alpha investors such as Blackrock caught in a rock and hard place. They are in search of investments that will generate return for their investors, while slowly abandoning the sinking ship. This is why most ESG investments are currently portfolios of tech stocks and such. On the other side of the equation there are the risk adverse pension funds that need to remain above water while investing ethically. Both are trying to aviod loss and so consequentially there in an incresing DEMAND FOR NEW MARKETS; we just need make them visible by offering them new investment pathways. This is good news for ReFi... if the space can take it's gaze off the carbon fallacy. Let's look beyond!

#### Methodologies
To solve global problems we need to coordinate across many local contexts. The best way of integrating these is to protocolise the information available and start doing the science. This means breaking away from monolithic institutional pathways and including the long tail and the many domain specific practices that have real impact on the planet. The challenge here is that the value isn't a commodity that can be extracted, it's implicit in ecosystem health and functionality. How do we measure that though? At a general level the metric to look at is free energy. More bird song, more insect activity, greater soil carrying capacity ect.

It's at this point that human intervention becomes important. What's the agenda and does it raise this measure of capacity? Are our interventions of relevance? Do they reach their ends? Are the ends in themselves valuable? Prove it. 

To do that we'll need to measure and test social practices. Again free energy seems like the metric. 







## Conclusion
- Tell them what you told them

We are NOT looking for investment or investors, instead we ARE looking for EXvestors. Folks funneling fiat from Game A to Game B.
