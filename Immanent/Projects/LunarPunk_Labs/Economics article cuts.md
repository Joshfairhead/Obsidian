Beta investors, with their lower risk tolerance - will prefer the security of noun like instruments like co2 tonnes due to their lack of volitility. This is the easiest pathway to markets as a) the Natural Capital paradigm is already established, and b) because the design of such an instrument is more predictable and mechanistic than a product truely representing the health of a living ecosystem. 

Alpha investors will generally be unsatisfied by the simplicity of noun like products; they hunt volitility in order to realise potential into profit. This trait of potential actualisation is desirable for regen markets as it's a mechanism that can be harnessed. From an economic perspective lets simply ask ourselves; where is the most unrealised potential? The long tail of environmental, social and governance causes. 

#### Quality
Improving our ESG heuristic to a finer degree of resolution we can infer the values of Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. The two former terms are social values and the latter two are governance oriented. Since we are relying on such heuristics  to financialise the activity of people and place through the production of protocols it becomes desirable for a regenerative vehicle to not only mitigate it's eco-socio-policical costs but to also generate and harmonise community values. 

Unlike facts, values are subject to contention and their discussion will often generate enough volitility to drive change and transformation. The more often they are measured the quicker certainty is gained. This harmonisation of values towards certainty can be measured as free energy above unity; which is also a single measure that can serve as an investable quantifier.

The key here is in valuing the verbs; flows and measures that are variable and dynamic in their nature. Keeping one eye on our goal of regenerative transformation we might direct the other half of our attention to proxy measures like organic biomass, bird song in the atmosphere, nutrient density of the crops and so forth. When we enumerate such values they take on such a hetrogeneity of forms that we find ourselves drowing in complexity. 
Consequentially there is need for a standardised ontology to integrate them all which is where distributed monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) becomes applicable.

## Ontologies
Theoretically any form of measurement can be encapsulated by such a schema; be they qualitive social values or quantitive mechanistic values - it doesn't really matter as far as the schema is concerned. We might consider it a very low level 'API' interface. 

Still, just becase our measures have been articulated doesn't mean that they have been accounted for. To gain legitimacy in the traditional system these measures will need to be evaluated in conformance to exogonous parameters like the books of an accountant. At this point we probably need a higher level ontology thats instutionally recognised such as REA accounting. This enables the instutional evaluation of our dMRV measurements.

We are nearly there; let's take in the view from this pleatau before carrying on up the mountain. We have a means to aggrigate measurements in the form of dMRV and we have a means to evaluate these measurements through REA accounting. The question that leads us to our mountains summit becomes; what do we evaluate our measurements against? 

With one eye still looking towards regeneration, we must consider what such a term actually means. This is undoubtedly a long metaphysical inquiry fraught with peril but let's skip writing a book on the Dramatic Universe for now and instead reference it to make an assertion; regeneration is free energy above unity - a form of harmony realised through the actualisation of potentials. 

Assuming such a statement is true, we can lean on active inferrencing (calculus) to evaluate the diversity of state measurements against a single unifying paramater. The numerical expression that arises can then function as a speculative asset; if harmony is produced over time then number goes up. If discord is produced over time then number goes down!

This market mechanism essentially provides a means to rate ESGs as well. Environmental, social and governance values can be evaluated against such a baseline. Any ontological preference set beyond this (such as DEIJs) can also be evaluated. The API is indifferent and consequentially any market that makes use of active inference to determine base lines is regenerative, unenclosable and anti-fragile. 

As this mechanism is an aggrigation over time it is subject to volitility and so fulfils hedge fund requirements for risk-on speculative markets. The more regenerative the credit the higher the profits in dollar amounts. The more profit is 'extracted' upstream the more wealth is internalised upstream. From an ethical point of view this channels energy and resources to its producers; proliteraiots and environmental stewards act as planetary generators.

#### Introduction
We now have a lever. Regenerative investment vehicals essentially represent the transformation of financial capital from a quantifier that externalises its costs into one that interanlises values. We will achieve this by converting markets from an existential liability into our greatest regenerative asset by aggrigating all forms of value into a single measurable proxy of free energy over unity.

*Tools to introduce here*

The essay puts forth a case that this measure is the perfect investment vehicle for reshaping the market landscape. In essence it asserts that we can harness speculation to divest humanity out of a debt based economic system into a thriving regenerative ecology. Attempts to extract value from this transformative system will ultimatly result in postive externalities and realise locked potential. It is therefore an antifragile market mechanism that cannot be captured by the extractive nature of capitalism.
