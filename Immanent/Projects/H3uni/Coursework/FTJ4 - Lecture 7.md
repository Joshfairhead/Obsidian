Facillitation in team and group sessions. Could go at the beginning but best to dip into the methods first instead. Gonna do it through several perspectives. 

- Saying a little about key/pre-conditions (context? agenda?)
- Participitave repatterning 
- Design element; not just showing up to be with the group
- Skill wheel (most effective way of interacting with the group)
- Managerial process; cant just show up on the day at the time - prep and pretinking...

Idea is not to transmit the knowlege and skill but more a demonstration to whet our appertites. Whirlwind tour of the resource library to get into active application.

#### Preconditions
- Not essential but if achieved it goes smoother... passing the cockroach test.
