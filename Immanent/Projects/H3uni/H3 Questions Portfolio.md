1) formulate the question (however badly)
2) ask yourself what assumptions you are ,or might be, making
3) mull over the question for a while
4) rather than focus on any answers you might presume, refocus on your question and see if it will benefit from reformulation
5) repeat 2 and 3
6) review what you have learned about your mental process from doing the above
7) start keeping track of the questions which don't 'go away'. This gradually forms a portfolio of areas that really matter to you, distinguishing between short term tactical and maybe life-time obsessional.

- Does the law of expansion (3-2-1) mean that the reconciler is used up in uniting the other two impulses? or is it only so in relation to two passive impulses?
	- Does a specific instantiation of this relationship apply to myself, Maija, Anthony? (feels related)
		- What implications does this have in general when related to other cosmic responsibilities? 
			- For instance upon request my good friend Ronen presented whats alive for him in relation to 'effectively deploying effective strategy' at Open Collective; If he's 'discharged' some part of a mandala thats important to him; what responsibility do I hold as a steward of the information shared? 
- Is the reconciler consequent on the nullad?
- Can one go meta with the decision discipline and place one of the six laws of three into the 'cosmic idea' place? What does expanding on the cosmic idea of expansion this lead to? what does concentrating on the cosmic idea of expansion lead to? What does expanding on local situation lead to? etc.
