# Harmonic Splinters
**Verse A**
- Splintered time, played by hands divine, paradigm of follow your own sundial.
- Instinctive right - you can keep yours but leave me mine, tick tight, lifes no free or breezy climb.

**Chorus**
- Burning with a sense, a sense for meter, but shadows a sunny pace
- Searching with a sense, a sense for meter, while cresting upon a wave

**Verse A**
- Broken count, try not overstep the bounds, beating deeper - you are your own clock keeper.
- Balancing mind the pulse soon solidifies, click calm as your battle rages on.

**Chorus**
- Blazing with a sense, a sense for meter, as sky meets the earth.
- Crashing with a sense, a sense for meter, as cymbols/symbols collide with surf.

**Verse B**
- Harmonic splinters, from the music tree, the broken braches and the falling leaves.
- Stretched head hides from the huted find, secures thoughts tight, fabricates the four parts of the one mind.

**Verse B**
- Rythmical sinders, fire lizard of our thoughts, intrinsic opposition grafts our unity.
- Misrules illusional, gratifies ridicule, reptiles tools, a primitive thought ticks and renews
