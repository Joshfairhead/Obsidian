# Beat Behind
**Verse**
- Beat behind, so tight on time; battered heads, sound another goodbye.
Loosened pressure yet gained a measure - a peace that's justified!
	Dotted rest stretched, took a break; chancing choice, with, illustrated intents
	Shaky strikes just return bad vibes so lets assume were friends!

**Bridge**
- A-ha-has night settles down
D-ha-hancing feet upon the ground

**Chorus**
- I'm grooving, you're grooving, come broken totem, treat your freak, dance your feet!
- Free movement, self-amusement, cultural cues reduce as we wage an outward truce

**Verse**
- Syncopates from the known terrain; darkened sky only little rain
Illusive weather could change for better **- takes a spell to play!**
Shaker stops; watching apex clocks, counting counts, with metric rocks
Session sways with simple chops, **paradox to stack the odds!**

**Bridge**
- A-ha-has night settles down
D-ha-h-ancing feet upon the ground

**Chorus**
- I'm grooving, you're grooving, come broken totem, treat your freak, dance your feet!
- Free movement, self-amusement, cultural cues reduce we choose to turn in truth

**Funk interlude x 2**

**Chorus**
- I'm grooving, you're grooving, come broken totem, treat your freak, dance your feet!
- Free movement, self-amusement, cultural cues reduce we wage an outward truce

**Verse**
- Burning blaze lets life ignite; vital warmth, echoes through to midnight
Ringing resound and a fire inside; gets us amplified!
- Dusk till dawn; no weary songs; ra-di-ate while resisting Armageddon 
A fumbled fill will make no odds if you just carry on!
