- Context
    - Last year I was participating in the Giveth Community which felt like it needed a kickstart.
    - Nature 2.0 presented in EthLondon where I heard about Odyssey.
    - At a community meeting I recommended we roll the EthDenver momentum into Odyssey which was a Commons oriented hackathon. It was a good story/memetic vehicle/schelling point to coordinate around. Shared attention.
    - We were able to gather five teams around the commons narrative.
    - Due to the numbers turning out we acquired an Air BnB rental - a Pirate Ship called Mars! Due to Odyssey's space memes this felt like an appropriately serendipitous story.
    - This was a pretty magical coliving and coworking experience that would be hard to forget. The Commons Stack emerged as a result. 
    - Some of us got into the story of nomadic cities and started dreaming of starting it with a boat. "Cabin fever and the cradle of civilisation" might be a way to develop general solutions to local problems outputting social critical infrastructure that might be exchanged with the countries visited. 
    - Because ships are expensive, we decided to start with LiminalVillage.com, which one of the participants in our community purchased to provision. 
    - We realised early on that physical space is a scarce resource and limiting factor so we decided to initialise Hackalong.io in sharable abundant digital space. We also initialised a telegram community which now has 118 participants that are active and intelligent. Still a healthy community.
    - We figured if the villages/cities/towns couldnt move (yet) so better to network several so the people can still move freely which is what we've done to degrees already, and are still doing with the likes of [[Akasha]] Hub(s) and Rat Park in Costa Rica. 
    - Now were converging for Odyssey again with three/four/(more) teams and have no boat. I thought festDAO might be a solution. Especially if we could get the likes of [[Ocean]] and Odyssey to chip in on the rental as the story is good publicity and the kind of bonkers stuff that can inspire people as we move into the exponentially novel future! [[PirateDAO]] is a potent meme, I like the potential header of "an Oceanic Hackalong Odyssey" if we can align stakeholders :)
    - I'm touching base here with FestDAO first but I'd really like to see a cocreative effort with the above parties. Thoughts welcome.
