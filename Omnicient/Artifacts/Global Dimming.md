# Global Dimming
- Potentially the most unspoken danger to life, and the uniting factor towards taking control of spaceship earth
- Theory: See short doc here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPj6K9TR1Tk
- **Pollution:**
    - Warms up the planet due to greenhouse gasses
    - Cools down the planet due to global dimming (water trapped in aerosols reflects sun into space)
- **Problem:**
    - Maintaining emissions would warm up the planet
    - Reducing emission would slowly slow down warming, but would remove cooling in a much greater way.
    - Consequences are raising temperatures beyond the survival of our biosphere.
- **Potential Solution**
    - Reduce emission while geoengineering the planed using purposedly released particles at the global scale [http://www.srmgi.org/what-is-srm/](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.srmgi.org%2Fwhat-is-srm%2F)
    - Immense and out of control changes to biosphere might occur. We need ways to finely control climate.
