- Contribution
    - The interpretive symbology workshops seek to foster the perceptive and interpretive arts. The dynamic and dramatic universe speaks in an implicit language of qualities sometimes known the 4th way, Tao, Implicate Order or Aether; of course these are just topologies as real mystery has no end! 
    - This space DOES NOT seek to make things clearer for you, just provide a grammar and perspective for articulating what you perceive. Only you can do the work. Life is real only when you are - DO NOT open your eyes if you DO NOT wish to inquire.
