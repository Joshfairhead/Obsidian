- [[Artifacts]]
- We are a network of co-creation locations.
- We welcome co-creators to stay and roam within the network 
- The [[Liminal]] association happens "in between" spaces, means that both spaces preserve their identity and agency, while they come to an agreement between them which makes them self-similar.
- Each place decides which [[Badges]] to accept and distribute. These might represent values, contributions, references, membership fees, and anything else.
- **Non-profit**
    - [ ] write statute (what the hell are we doing)
        - Agents are people who participate in the network
        - Agents roles: 
            - Mentors: time & skills
            - Stewards: take care of assigned places as their own, regenerating them.
            - Ambassadors: are residents members in one of the locations, roam around other representing the projects of that location
        - In exchange for their participation, all agents get a [[Transitional Basic Income]], going towards having their basic needs met (eg: shelter, food, water)
        - Resources providers: 
            - participate in the network by sharing: land,spaces, tools, goods, services
            - They enter an easement contract.
            - In exchange for their donation, they get expenses repaid (utilities + maintenance)
    - Purpose: members research and develop [[Open Source]] technology for the betterment of people and planet.

        - Spaces: Upon selling of the location, initial property valuation (agreed upon at the moment of onboarding) goes to owner. Stewards and network and owner divide the added regenerated value equally.
        - Time: Upon commercial activity of the solution, rewards are split equally from contributors, hosting locations, and the network. 
- **How do you make money?**
    - People donate their locations and their time.
