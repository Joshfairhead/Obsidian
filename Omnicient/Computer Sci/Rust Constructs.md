# Rust Constructs
- **Stack**
    - Last in First out
    - Is fast because othe thw way it accesses the data
        - Never has to search for a plasce to put or place to get data
        - Value type Variables, store on stack 
- **Heap**
    - Size unknown at compile time and might change
    - finds memory of a size and saves the pointer
    - Reference type Variables, store on heap
- **Why rust?**
    - C/C++ = low level that ends up buggy due to the amount of control (handled by developers)
    - [[Python]] = high level that lacks control because memory management is automated
    - Rust = somewhere between 
- **Immutable variable**
    - Variables which never change (read only) 
- **Mutable variable**
    - Variables which are changable
- **Ownership rules**
    - Compiler enforce:
        - Every resources has a unique owner
        - there can only be one owner at a time
        - When owner foes out of scope the value will be dropped
    - "items" may be borrowed 
- **Referencing rules**
    - We only have 
        - One mutable reference
        - or
        - Many Immutable references
    - None "dangling references"
- **Ownership in value types**
    - Value types are copied automaticallly while sending as params or assigning oanothe one
    - Since its a new copy of variable there is no problem wiht ownership
    - Just remember which data types are value type (on stack) or reference type (on heap)
- **Clone**
    - This command returns back a copy of data with new ownership
    - A soloution to fix ownership in reference type
- **Closure**
    - Rusts closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions
    - fn //function (dynamic?)
    - let //argument that closes the function = closure
    - Often called anonymous functions, or lambda functions. 
- **Macro**
    - Macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which is known as meta-programming
    - See a (!) = Macro
- **Exception **
    - There is no try catch in rust. All exception should be managed by __result__ and __option__
    - Panic! = dont know what to do... stop!
    - Result <T,E>
        - Result is the type used for returning and propogating errors
        - If return i sucess and containing value Ok(T)
        - if the return represents an error Err(E)
    - Option
        - The option type is used in many places because it encodes the very common scenarion in which a value could be something or it could be nothing
        - Something (T) = some(T)
            - __Unwrap__ will remove the some of some(4), giving access to the 4
        - Nothing
- **Strings in Rust**
    - &str (string literal) e.g. "blah blah"
        - Fixed size
        - Value type
        - Allocatpe memory on stack
    - String
        - Dynamic size 
        - Reference type
        - Allocate memory on heap
    - Into()
        - A value to value conversation that consumes the input value (takes ownership of input value)
    - Module
        - A Module is a namespace that contains definations or types and you can choose if these definitions are visible (public) or not (private)
        - To create a module you create a file and name it with .rs on the end. Now you have a module. 
    - Crate
        - A craet is a binary or library
        - Main.rs as a root file is an executable 
        - Lib.rs is a library
    - Package
        - One or more crates that provide a set of functionality
    - Extern crate
    - Use declarations
        - Import Equivelent in Rust
    - Enum, Struct, Trait



#### Chat from the call
- From Me to Everyone: (12:31 pm)
	- So is Heap good for mutable variable and stack good for immutable variables?
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (12:35 pm)
	- foo and bar are used as templates\placeholders without specific meaning @Josh
- From Me to Everyone: (12:37 pm)
	- Thanks!
- From Trevor Hilder to Me: (Privately) (12:37 pm)
	- Hi Josh. Foo and Bar comes from a joke - fubar means “fucked up beyond belief” :-)
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (12:37 pm)
	- yeap
- From Fábio Corrêa to Everyone: (12:37 pm)
	- The Book is the canonical source for being introduced and learning Rust… https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (12:38 pm)
	- Another good place to start: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
- From rhyzom to Everyone: (12:38 pm)
	- i just realized why they chose the name rust, lol
- From Trevor Hilder to Me: (Privately) (12:39 pm)
	- They are just arbitrary names originating with that joke.
- From Me to Trevor Hilder: (Privately) (12:39 pm)
	- Star
- From Trevor Hilder to Me: (Privately) (12:41 pm)
	- Most people have forgotten about the original joke :-)
- From Me to Trevor Hilder: (Privately) (12:51 pm)
	- fn //function
- From Me to Guillem Cordoba: (Privately) (12:52 pm)
	- fn //function
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (12:57 pm)
	- All good!
- From rhyzom to Everyone: (12:57 pm)
	- yea, all good
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (12:57 pm)
	- nope :)
- From [[Thomas]] cal to Everyone: (12:58 pm)
	- awesome
- From Karl to Everyone: (01:02 pm)
	- hey folks I unfortunately have to leave the call! I have a follow up call that I can not dismiss. Looking forward for the Dev Camp and that we are seeing us next week on 22.01. Have a nice week&weekend :) Thank you Hedayat for the good overview. I will rewatch the whole video asap :)
- From anton to Everyone: (01:02 pm)
	- see ya !
- From [[Raphi]] See to Everyone: (01:02 pm)
	- bye Karl! See you soon
- From Me to Everyone: (01:05 pm)
	- Maybe I missed something but what are <T, E> representing?
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (01:07 pm)
	- @Josh, different type of variables (results) returned
- From Me to Everyone: (01:07 pm)
	- Thanks again :))
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (01:07 pm)
	- in case everything is fine T is returned and if the code fails you get E
- From milkyklim to Everyone: (01:08 pm)
	- ^ this should hold true 99.9% of the time :)
- From [[Raphi]] See to Everyone: (01:16 pm)
	- This is a good place to learn Rust more in depth: https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-lang/
- From Razvan to Everyone: (01:18 pm)
	- What time does today's session end?
