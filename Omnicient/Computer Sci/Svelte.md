# Svelte

## Notes
- Javascript is the only language that runs in the client/browser. 
- Modern web apps use single page builds and API interfaces (json)
- Svelte is a compiler not a framework
- Frameworks like Vue and your code are usually shipped together, and then the server serves compiled responses to the client. 
- Svelte is a compiler that packs your code into vanilla machine readable JS which is then run on server.
- Each Svelte page is a component
	- Components are made up of 
		- <script> = logic
		- <style> = css
		- html elements (no tag, just a line break)
