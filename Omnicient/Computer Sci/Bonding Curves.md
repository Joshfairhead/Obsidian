# Bonding Curves
Calculus in cryptoland. These are curves used to determine ratios. In cryptoland this is typically a swap of tokens between makers and takers. In fact the primary use of bonding curves at the time of writing is as an automatic market maker (Bancor, Uniswap etc.). 

#### Forms
- Bonding curves (curve fitting)
- Single curve - non-profit
- Dual curve - for profit
- Straight curve - no incentives
- Concave - incentivises pumps, exit race likely
- Convex - incentivises holding, exit race less likely, strange mechanisms around the head/initial conditions
