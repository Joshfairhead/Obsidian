[[Holochain]]

- Homework
    - [@Architecture-Course](https://forum.holochain.org/groups/architecture-course)
    - In Session #3 we explored different strategies for addressing challenges with eventual consistency and no absolute time reference. e.g. How can you tally votes accurately?
    - We also addressed a lot of questions about permissions/roles (implemented in validation rules) and sharing access to private data/actions (implemented via capability grants).
    - For next week we want to try to address a couple common challenges:
        - Rivalrous data – How do you address address collisions to establish unique names for users or groups?
        - Membranes – How do you protect from people messing with your system by manufacturing lots of fake Sybil accounts?
    - There are a variety of ways to tackle both of these issues. What works best for your Holochain needs?
    - See you next week!
