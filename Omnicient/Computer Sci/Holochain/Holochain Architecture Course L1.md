[[Holochain]] [[Call Notes]]

- Updating the HDK
- Designed tobe more concurrent
- Redux was an anti-pattern
- Native recognition of countersigning/multi-party sigs
    - Fetching multiple patterns from multiple agents will be much easier
- [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/9BI8OQKhSAKyZ5Kc95cJcg)
- Whats Lamport, whats concurrency? (Martin DOW)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B
- From [[Jakub]]
    - In terms of computer science grounding, new volume of "Treatise on Systems" from Mark Burgess is out, focusing on intentional distributed systems.
    - From [[Jakub]] Lanc to Everyone: (08:40 pm)
        - http://markburgess.org/treatise_vol2.pdf
- Deining membranes medical use case
    - Personal/device DHT
    - Access to parents etc - pre approved
    - Market = transport
- Membranes - Q1 - What are your membranes?
    - Slack app with channels as micros services
- Modularity and code reuse
    - What can be reused / mixed in? Integration
- Entries
    - Colums in relational database
    - Graph schema
    - What makes the data valid, what are we including
    - Functions that are allowed e.g. CRUD
    - Colllisions - how to avoid them, do we care (structure determines the address)
    - Rivalrous data issues? 
    - Entry private, hash public. E.g. exposing dice rolls in a game
    - Headers are a system type, not happ structure
        - [Specs](https://docs.rs/holochain_core_types/0.0.45-alpha1/holochain_core_types/chain_header/struct.ChainHeader.html)
        - Hash of the data
        - Hasho of the previous data
        - Data type
        - Signature -> changing to self signing
        - Previous entry of same type ->removing
        - Local time stamp
    - Essentially a distributed CRDT
        - CRDT = Conflict-free replicated data type
        - Entry and header transform into 
        - "In the real world reality is multi-valent"
            - Forking change path
            - If deterministic we need a method to resolve
            - Couple of ways in regardds to links
                - Call back is the way to resolve
                    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)
                    - example of a callback in a holochain app are "receive", "validate_agent"â€©
