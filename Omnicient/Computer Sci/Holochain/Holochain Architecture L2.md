[[Holochain]]

- Homework
    - Continuing on the trajectory we started last week for [building a Reddit like site for discussion forums](https://forum.holochain.org/t/session-1-homework/2501/9), how would you go about adding reputation or voting to the system?
    - How would you protect from gaming or abuse of voting or reputation on a P2P app?
    - If you wanted to use votes to make a decision, approve a feature update, or elect a representative, how would you know if you’ve collected all the votes on an eventually consistent system like Holochain?
    - Outline key elements of your design or solution for addressing these issues.
    - Next week we will continue to address [people’s questions from this session 1](https://hackmd.io/LoMJmGR0RfSkj8vXi2u33w) and hopefully have a new batch of questions from figuring out ways to address voting/reputation.
