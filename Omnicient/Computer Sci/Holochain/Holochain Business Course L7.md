    - Find the deepest pain, hold it -- and then do commercials
    - Find people that are ready to recive what you may offer

    - Operating globally
    - Focus of society on either solidarity or competition
    - Import and Export tax
    - Cultural differences
    - Scale free operation means abiding with legal frameworks that are probably stupid and fraile
    - Laws that I am unaware of.
    - Digital currency regulations
    - Lack of “commons” related discourse, legislature
    - Obsession with techny solutions without the human underpinning
    - The business adaptive landscape selects for competition and exploitation, what to do?
    - Dont deviate from the norms past 5% - past this is likely to result in severe clampdowns and push back from whatever the forces of power might be. Make sure to push past 0% or fail out of stasis - Eustress or atrophy

            - There is a slight unease I have about an agent centric world. I am not sure everyone really wants to take full responsibility and many people actually like being led in a clear way. For them it is enough to complain about the government and earn enough money to pay the mortgage.Thinking about upward spirals, I keep thinking about where the upper slopes are where little changes can lead to a changed landscape without having to worry about the people and their behaviour “further down”. And maybe that is all that needed and time will look after the rest. But I would like to see big impacts, fast.
            - WE all have a blind spot - open up vasts amounts of information right away

- ## Template 3 - shared; how do you choose to operate
    - **Question**
        - What’s your leadership style?
    - **Answer...**
        - What is the gap between your image and the reality (how others really experience you / results & how do you close that gap?
        - Jump levels, span time and truly participate
        - Hardest working + ability to communicate vision
        - Holding the vision, bringing people in, outlining a strategy.
        - See value in everyone, use tools and templates where they make sense- set up people to be their CEOs and see what happens
        - Focus on what matters, and inspire people to be themselves in order to get there
        - Continually learn and grow and turn that into what I think are the most exciting things to work on
        - Work with amazing people and learn everything from them
        - In my image, everybody is on the same page, bought it - in reality there is way more dissonance and i am believing what i choose to believe
        - How do i close the gap: keep looking at myself
        - Hands-on, part of the team, inspiring through care for the team. Gap: would like to empower my team more, but often find myself stuck in the details
        - An inability to communicate my thinking, or the steps I ran through in my head.
        - Inviting into a larger narrative, inviting co-creation, helping build the tools.  Gap: Sustaining continuous drive / rhythm.
        - Coaching to support self-starter motivation
        - Letting people be themselves.
        - Letting go as much as possible and not being a leader at all. Just let it all happen and respond accordingly.

        - Know the way, tell the way, and show the way. Gap: Consistency
        - Does your vision support your game and enable your network? Does the vision be tweaked so it truly fits?
        - Yes - feels like only minor tweaks needed. And some clear articulation of the rules.
        - ..Vision and game are aligned, but not all day to day decisions. Sometimes too much driven by what clients want, rather than what I want. Giving way more than asking to be paid for.
        - The vision interferes with the game as it creates frustration in the juxtaposition of now.
        - Needs adjusting to suit available near-term opportunity.
        - My game supports my game. It does enable my network too. Nope, gotta live with compromise
        - Yes, but there is still some time until full execution. Still learning.
        - My vision is always changing - what i want for the world feels like it narrows into how can I be myself, today, in this moment and at all times
        - Will others like my vision - who knows - do others like their visions; i hope so!!
        - How do you expect to achieve your vision from where you are today? What are the simple things to get there?
        - Yes. But the timeline is uncertain - I have to learn to get comfortable with the uncertainty of when things will come together.
        - Get clearer and clear about what I do that matters to others!!! Also get a good feedback loop between this and my vision. My vision is still WIP.
        - Achieve vision through consistent, determined work.
        - Make sure to also get mine, not just growing ours
        - Find the people that want to live in the same world I want to live in, connect them and give them tools
        - Consistent focus. Healthy culture. Right mindset. Develop good habits
        - Create a core team. Jumpstart regular meetings. Kick-off workshops.
        - Crypto moon. Finish my book. Build investor engine. Keep working on client projects. Develop personal branding. Express without filters.
        - Surround myself with people I can learn from
        - Complete book. Build personal brand. Network more. Much more.
        - Keep working with amazing people who give me feedback and i can learn from
        - Work on the map, work on the commitments hApp. Bring in CCs and interconnect, open doors for Holochain integrations.
        - Ask for help every day
        - Remember people, appreciate them
        - Do only what I am absolutely best at, and find others to do the rest
        - Get my feedback loops right
        - Trust my instinct and create space to listen
        - Not having a utopian like vision, but navigating the possibilities with what feels right
        - How do you stimulate creativity and keep your business innovative as it evolves?
        - Keep the long-term vision alive while providing what clients and my team want today
        - Hold the light of creativity bright myself - foster a culture of asking hard questions, without fear of rubbing against each other.
        - Regular Ideation sessions. Hang outside of work.
        - Diagramming. Learning. Discussion.
        - Reflect and assess on what works and what doesn’t work
        - Be open and disciplined
        - Know when I am listening to my pain or listening to a true opportunity

        - Attuning to energy of completion
        - What if we all turned this flywheel, made these breakthroughs together
- ## Template 5 - shared; how does it all end
    - **Question**
        - What does failure look like?
    - **Answer...**
        - Failure is to stop believing that the vision can be achieved
        - Like a book
        - Resignation and distraction
        - What we have designed needs to mutate into something new.
        - Finding another way not to do something
        - Failure is a breakdown of complexity
        - Best thing ever happened
        - It never happened
        - Like a rebirth and new possibilities.
        - I got to somewhere, got lazy, and didn’t pull through to a point where it spread/grew by itself.
        - Every moment is a failure, but failure isn’t bad
        - How does the business fold? What caused it?
        - It was not required any more and had delivered the value and learning to all involved. Like a plant, it dies off to be the compost to its offsprings
        - People weren’t really interested in what I am building, which breaks me, or leaves me too exhausted to continue.
        - Distraction derailed it, or a better opportunity replaced it
        - Like a protein, it turns into something else and activates new receptors
        - It could not be supported by the surrounding system
        - At the end, what did you celebrate?
        - Celebrate being together with the people, the love between us,
        - The opportunity to give it everything, and to release my expression
        - The relationship, the work, achievements,
        - The learning, the belonging, the open and safe space
        - The learning
        - The end! The new beginning!
    - **Reflections - what I learned and am applying for my game**
        - I got the feeling - it’s ok to die
        - Always layers to the questions and answers - take something, leave something behind
        - The present can’t die; failure is part of the transformation
        - A feeling of denial - no i can’t fail, it can’t happen to me
        - This only really ends when i give up, it’s not bound by resources like other traditional startups
        - Don’t be scared of running out of money
        - Subject vs object - changing the position
        - The end is something worth celebrating - the vision is achieved, it’s out in the world; like a tree that gives space, falls over and gives space for something new to grow
        - Keep evolving the frame
        - Good to realise now the smaller milestones are ends in themselves that also build the bigger picture. Don’t resent the near-term opportunities.
        - Structure isn’t hard, scary or unnecessary when it is around something you care about (anti-structure person speaking)
        - Interesting to read that the end of the business is the same as failure for many. I want to build businesses where the end is backed in and a reason to celebrate because the vision  has been achieved.
- ## Everything else I want or need to share about running my business
    - To know but not to do, is not to know - Gavriel
    - Philosophy starts and ends in the head (and in the hands putting it into action)
    - I came to realise over the years how vitally important the personal network becomes over time. Seeds sown early bare fruit later on. Keep connecting with people. Keep in touch. Be kind. Be helpful. Be assertive to add your voice to the conversation.
    - There is no shame in expressing what you believe in, and backing that vision all the way.
