#### Structure
- Properties
	- `this.property`
- Functions `{}`
	- `function double(number) {return number * 2};`
		- Declare function, declare function name, (declare variable), {keyword, variable, * 2};
	- Methods are function definition statements in `{}`
	- `function () {this.property + this.property}`
	- Once having defined a function, you can call it with different values

## Learn JS Highlights

### Basic operations
- The first time you define a variable, you have to define it with let, however the next time you use that variable, you should NOT use let anymore

### Basic functions
- A function is a reusable piece of code that performs some logic and gives you a result.
- For example, assuming we have a function `sum`, then writing `sum(3, 5)` will give us the sum of 3 and 5 which is 8
- There's an important benefit of functions, which is **reusability**
- The function keyword is used to define a function. This allows you to group related code logic together to make a reusable task.
- **return** is an important keyword used to give the _result_ of the function
- Note that the `return` keyword can **only** be used **inside** a function.
