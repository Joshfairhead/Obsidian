- A Definition: __Identity is how we keep track of people and things and, in turn, how they keep track of us.__
- Digital identities are simply tools which help organizations and individuals manage real-world identity. In the simplest terms, digital identities help keep track of people digitally. An identity system is a collection of tools and techniques used to keep track of people and things. We treat people differently based on their identity: treating our friends and family differently from strangers and known threats
- In the diagrams below, the blue boxes are nouns and the red ovals are verbs – the building blocks for describing identity systems. We start with the simplest identity system, using three nouns and a verb: ![](https://github.com/Joshfairhead/Resources/raw/master/Identity%20Images/Sub_Att_ID.png?raw=true)
	- Subjects are entities—people or things—under consideration.
	- Identifiers are labels which refer to entities. They are used to keep track of what we know about those entities.
	- Attributes are what we know about people and things. They describe the state, appearance, or other qualities of an entity.
	- Correlate means to associate attributes with particular entities, to associate what we know about someone with either an identifier in the system or a subject in question.

- Existence. Users must have an independent existence.
- Control. Users must control their identities.
- Access. Users must have access to their own data.
- Transparency. Systems and algorithms must be transparent.
- Persistence. Identities must be long-lived.
- Portability. Information and services about identity must be transportable.
- Interoperability. Identities should be as widely usable as possible.
- Consent. Users must agree to the use of their identity.
- Minimalization. Disclosure of claims must be minimized.
- Protection. The rights of users must be protected.
- User should be the identities root and executor. ID should reside with the user who can temporarily home it where they see fit. In short DID’s provide a methodology for proving control over a key.

- At a superficial level, a decentralized identifier (DID) is simply a new type of globally unique identifier with special features designed for blockchains. But at a deeper level, DIDs are actually the tip of the iceberg of an entirely new layer of decentralized digital identity and public key infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. Every identifier that is both globally unique and globally resolvable to date has required some type of centralized administration. This architecture has long been recognized as both a single point of control (and thus potential censorship) and a single point of failure
- The XDI.org Registry Working Group began looking for a decentralized solution for identifying participants in a global peer-to-peer XDI semantic data interchange network.
- The DID concepts are old and are bundled into UUID and URN but neither inherently address the ability to cryptographically verify ownership of the identifier.
- ![](https://github.com/Joshfairhead/Resources/raw/master/Identity%20Images/Sceme_Method_identifer.png?raw=true)
- The DID example above uses the Sovrin DID method in which the method-specific identifier is generated by base-56-encoding the first half of an Ed25519 verification key.
- DID Documents Scheme (key-value database) Key is a DID, Value is a DID document Purpose of the DID document is to describe the public keys and service endpoints necessary to bootstrap cryptographically verifiable interactions with the identified entity.
- DID JSON components:
	- The DID itself, so the DID document is fully self-describing.
	- A set of public keys or other proofs that can be used for authentication or interaction with the identified entity.
	- A set of service endpoints that describe where and how to interact with the identified entity.
	- A set of authorized capabilities for the identified entity -- or other delegated entities -- to make changes to the DID document.
	- Timestamps for auditing.
	- A optional JSON-LD signature if needed for verifying the integrity of the document.
- DID Methods A specific goal of DID architecture is to enable DIDs and DID documents to be adapted to any modern blockchain, distributed ledger, or other decentralized network capable of resolving a unique key into a unique value. It does not matter whether the blockchain is public, private, permissionless, or permission. What does matter is how a DID and DID document are created, resolved, and managed on a specific blockchain.
	- The DID method name.
	- The ABNF structure of the method-specific identifier.
	- How the method-specific identifier is generated or derived.
	- How the CRUD operations are performed on a DID and DID document: a. Creating a new DID. b. Reading (resolving) a DID document. c. Updating a DID document. d. Deleting (revoking) a DID.
- CRUDs are likely to vary the most across different DID methods:
	- Create. Some DID methods may generate a DID directly from a cryptographic key pair. Others may use the address of a transaction or a smart contract on the blockchain itself.
	- Read. Some DID methods use blockchains that can store DID documents directly on the blockchain. Others may instruct DID resolvers to construct them dynamically based on attributes of a blockchain record. Still others may store a pointer on the blockchain to a DID document stored in one or more parts on other decentralized storage networks such as IPFS or STORJ.
	- Update. The update operation is the most critical from a security standpoint because control of a DID document represents control of the public keys or proofs necessary to authenticate an entity (and therefore for an attacker to impersonate the entity). Since verification of DID document update permissions can only be enforced by the target blockchain, the DID method specification must define precisely how authentication and authorization are performed for any update operation.
	- Delete. DID entries on a blockchain are by definition immutable, so they can never be “deleted” in the conventional database sense. However they can be revoked in the cryptographic sense. A DID method specification must define how this termination is performed, e.g., by writing a null DID document.
- ## Related Specifications
	- DID’s are the “atomic units” of a new layer of decentralised identity infrastructure. Decentralised Key Management System, DID TLS, DID names, DID auth.
	- DKMS: Decentralised Identity requires DKMS. Managing the lifecycle of private keys and other private data associated with a DID in a way that is interoperable across different blockchains, apps, and vendors is the focus of the DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) specification. Based on NIST Special Publication 800-130, “A Framework for Designing Key Management Systems”.
	- DID TLS: DID TLS decentralizes the standard X.509 cert elements required to establish a TLS session to be generated dynamically from any DID and DID document that conforms to the DID spec.
	- DID Names: The DID specification is intentionally limited to machine-generated decentralised identifiers lacking in human readability. However there are many use cases where it is desirable to be able to discover a DID using a human-friendly semantic name. Such a naming service would look like a flat, cryptographically-verifiable version of DNS (no centralised registries or registrars - made by user on the blockchain).
	- DID auth: Challenge/response authentication protocol that will work with any DID that supports it.
	- DID Privacy by design
		- Pairwise-unique DIDs. While DIDs can be used as well-known public identifiers, they can also be used as private identifiers issued on a per-relationship basis. So rather than a person having a single DID, like a cell phone number or national ID number, she can have hundreds of pairwise-unique DIDs that cannot be correlated without her consent, yet can still be managed as easily as an address book.
		- Off-chain private data. Storing any type of PII on a public blockchain, even encrypted or hashed, is dangerous for two reasons: 1) the encrypted or hashed data is a global correlation point when the data is shared with multiple parties, and 2) if the encryption is eventually broken (e.g., [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing)), the data will be forever accessible on an immutable public ledger. So the best practice is to store all private data off-chain and exchange it only over encrypted, private, peer-to-peer connections.
		- Selective disclosure. The decentralized PKI (DPKI) that DIDs make possible opens the door to individuals gaining greater control over their personal data in two ways. First, it enables it to be shared using encrypted digital credentials (see below). Second, these credentials can use [Zero-Knowlege Proof Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) for [data minimization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/03/16/why-data-minimization-is-an-important-concept-in-the-age-of-big-data/[[34e142931da4]]) e.g., you can disclose that you are over a certain age without disclosing your exact birthdate.
	- DID and verifiable claims DIDs are a base layer of decentralised identity infrastructure. The next layer higher where most value is unlocked is Verifiable Claims. [Please check primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-claims-primer.md).

# VC Primer

- It is currently difficult to transmit credentials such as driver's licenses, proofs of age, education qualifications, and healthcare data, via the Internet in a way that is verifiable yet protects individual privacy. These credentials are composed of statements called verifiable claims.
- Verifiable Claims are useful when a person needs to prove that they are:
	- above a certain age,
	- capable of driving a particular motor vehicle,
	- require a particular medication,
	- trained and certified as an electrician,
	- professionally licensed to practice medicine, and
	- cleared to travel internationally.
- The Verifiable Claims ecosystem is composed of four primary roles:
	- The Issuer, who issues verifiable credentials about a specific Subject.
	- The Holder stores credentials on behalf of a Subject. Holders are typically also the Subject of a credential.
	- The Verifier requests a profile of the Subject. A profile contains a specific set of credentials. The verifier verifies that the credentials provided in the profile are fit-for-purpose.
	- The Identifier Registry is a mechanism that is used to issue identifiers for Subjects. A visual depiction of the ecosystem above is shown below: ![](https://github.com/Joshfairhead/Resources/raw/master/Identity%20Images/Verifiable_claims_primer.png?raw=true)
- The ecosystem roles exchange data that enables the realization of the previously mentioned use cases. The data that is exchanged differs based on the roles participating, but is fundamentally composed of Claims, Credentials, and Profiles.
- A claim is statement about a subject, expressed as a subject-property-value relationship: ![](https://github.com/Joshfairhead/Resources/raw/master/Identity%20Images/claimisastatement.png?raw=true)
- When an Issuer sends data to a Holder, it bundles a set of claims into a data structure called a credential and digitally signs the data structure: ![](https://github.com/Joshfairhead/Resources/raw/master/Identity%20Images/Verifiablecredential.png?raw=true)
- When a Verifier asks for data from a Holder, the Holder typically bundles a set of credentials into a data structure called a profile and digitally signs the data structure: ![](https://github.com/Joshfairhead/Resources/raw/master/Identity%20Images/verifiableprofile.png?raw=true)

# Universal Resolver
- The Universal Resolver is directly related to the work that has been done by the Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust and Internet Identity Workshop communities around a Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which support different “methods” for registering identifiers on decentralized systems such as the Bitcoin blockchain, Sovrin, Ethereum, IPFS, and others. Note that the DID spec is currently undergoing a “hardening” phase, and that the work presented here is an early developers’ implementation meant to encourage the participation of the community and to accelerate the joint development of key decentralized identity primitives.
- This tool fulfills a similar purpose as Bind does in the DNS system: resolution of identifiers. However, instead of working with domain names, we work with self-sovereign identifiers that can be created and registered directly by the entities they refer to.
- This is important, because identifiers are the basis for any identity and communications system — without identifiers, we cannot have relationships, transactions, data sharing or messaging between entities. Historically identifiers have always been assigned to us by some kind of corporate or state authority. The Universal Resolver lets us build architectures and protocols on top of identifiers that are completely self-sovereign
- However, just having an identifier is not enough. We need some further information in order to know how to communicate with the entity represented by the identifier. The job of a “Resolver” is to discover and retrieve this further information.
- Resolver reads > Identifier to get method/driver Resolver uses driver to query> Service for DID document (endpoints) Resolver uses DID specified endpoints to point App to required content on IPFS etc
