# Business Process Model and Notation

#### About
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for business process modeling that provides a graphical notation for specifying business processes in a _Business Process Diagram_ (BPD) based on a flowcharting technique very similar to activity diagrams from Unified Modeling Language. 

The objective of BPMN is to support business process management, for both technical users and business users, by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users, yet able to represent complex process semantics. The BPMN specification also provides a mapping between the graphics of the notation and the underlying constructs of execution languages, particularly Business Process Execution Language
