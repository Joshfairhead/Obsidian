- The `fundamental attribution error` is that we explain by permanent, enduring traits what would be better explained by circumstance and context; AKA `contingent environmental circumstances`.
- The `planning fallacy` states that reality usually delivers results a little worse than the 'worst-case scenario'. The best way to fix it is to ask how long things took the last time you tried them. That's called using the outside view instead of the inside view. But when you're doing something new and can't do that, you just have to be really, really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic that reality actually comes out _better_ than you expected around as often and as much as it comes out worse. It's actually _really hard_ to be _so_ pessimistic that you stand a decent chance of _undershooting_ real life!

- > Maintaining the current status hierarchy and enforcing its rules seems ever so much more wise and moral and important when you are on the top and doing the enforcing than when you are on the bottom, and I can cite studies to this effect if required. I could go on for several hours about this point, but I will leave it at that
- The import of an act lies not in what that act _resembles on the surface_, but in the states of mind which make that act more or less probable. This is the dichotomy between the `representativeness heuristic` and the Bayesian definition of evidence.
- `preference utilitarianism`; the ethical theory that the good is what satisfies the preferences of the most people
- `planning fallacy`; overestimation of whats possible due to a positivity bias
- `advance commitment` creates a pressure for later consistency
- `Lake Wobegon effect` overestimatoion of ones abiliies
- `Asch's Conformity Experiment`; Asch found that people were willing to ignore reality and give an incorrect answer in order to conform to the rest of the group.
- `Litany of Tarski` is **a template to remind oneself that beliefs should stem from reality**, from what actually is, as opposed to what we want, or what would be convenient. For any statement X, the litany takes the form "If X, I desire to believe that X".
- `Litany of Gendlin`: What's true is already so, owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
- Robyn Dawes: the harder a problem is, the more likely people are to try and solve it immediately
