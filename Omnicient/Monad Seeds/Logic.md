# Logic

## Logic: A Science Primer - [[Prof. Jevons]]

Two forms of reasoning are introduced
- Inductive
- Deductive

Reason is the act of gaining knowlege from other knowlege

### Deductive reasoning
3: All *mushrooms* are **good to eat** 
6: This fungus is a *mushroom*
9: Therefore this fungus is **good to eat**.

The above is a syllogism or an argument.
The argument or syllogism above consists of three propositions. 
When we join propositions like this we are reasoning.

There are three ingredients to deductive logic:
- Proposition 
- Terms
- Syllogism

Note that all three terms are also used twice.
- Mushrooms
- Fungus
- Good to eat

Also note that each proposition is of a different modality. It therefore seems to me that there is a hidden ennegram at play. Theres probably a way to state this logically. 

#### Terms
**Terms are more than just names.** They can consist of any number of nouns, substatives or adjectives, with articles, prepositions and the conjunctions required to join them. **They connect things together in singulatity** as a single object, collection or class of objects.

- 3: **Singular terms**; "British museum", "Pompeis Pillar" are names of single things.
- 6: **General terms**; are the most common and refer to conceptually fungible things that are seperate from all other things. e.g. Shillings, Tokens, Cups, Chairs. 
- 9: **Collective terms**; are terms that collect conceptually non-fungible things together creating a whole from other wholes. E.g. Europe.

Don't confuse General terms with Collective terms; they are of different qualityies.

Terms can also be **concrete** or **abstract**. 
- **Concrete terms** are most terms that can be put in plural: house, mountain, slate.
- **Abstract terms** are qualities, properties or accidents that belong to things: magnitude of a house, elevation of a mountain, colour of slate, thickness of a phone, etc.

**Perfectly abstract terms cannot be plural**. Pluralised abstractions are necesserily conjoined to the concrete: e.g. Colour(s) of a house. Colours is an (imperfectly) abstract term. House is a concrete term. 

Terms can also be **positive** or **abstract**.
- Generally we give names to things due to a particular quality
- In other cases we give names to things due to a lack of a particular quality
	- For example: un-, a-, an-, im-, non-, or -less.
- Some terms break from and substitute for these conventions.
	- "immaleable" is weird and often "brittle" is substituted
	- Transparent/opaque
	- True/false
	- Dry/moist
	- Rough/smooth
	- Verse/prose
- **Some distinctions commit fallicies** as they are not the negative of eachother. 
	- Big is not the negative of small.
