# Logic

## Logic: A Science Primer - [[Prof. Jevons]]

Two forms of reasoning are introduced
- Inductive
- Deductive

Reason is the act of gaining knowlege from other knowlege

### Deductive reasoning
3: All *mushrooms* are **good to eat** 
6: This fungus is a *mushroom*
9: Therefore this fungus is **good to eat**.

The above is a syllogism or an argument.
The argument or syllogism above consists of three propositions. 
When we join propositions like this we are reasoning.

There are three ingredients to deductive logic:
- Proposition 
- Terms
- Syllogism

Note that all three terms are also used twice.
- Mushrooms
- Fungus
- Good to eat

Also note that each proposition is of a different modality. It therefore seems to me that there is a hidden ennegram at play. Theres probably a way to state this logically.
