> The fundamental consideration of any domain can be (must be) resolved into exactly three concepts, each of which are primal and necessary to the very essence of that domain. This is known to be possible for all domains.  
  
> These three concepts (the modalities), which form the most basic foundation and logic of that domain, have a definite and describable pattern of roles that each plays with respect to the other two, and in the domain as a whole.  
  
> The basic pattern of roles is common to the foundations of all domains. The _same_ pattern of roles between these three fundamental, necessary, and intrinsic concepts will be found as the essence of all domains.

> The term 'modality' is generally used to refer to a specific type of role, as selected from a finite set of available types. Three such types, (or roles), and the relations between them, are both necessary and sufficient to provide a complete description of this metaphysics.  
  
> In that the general pattern of relative roles is common to the foundations of all domains, each of the three roles is given a specific name, a modality, which is then used to refer to the class of all concepts that have that type of role.

> The three modalities are the three terms used to refer to each of the three primal roles that form the essential basis necessary to the consideration of each domain. To consider the modality of a concept is to consider the essential role that concept plays with respect to other primal concepts.  
  
> The names given to the three roles (modalities) that domain primal concepts have with respect to one another are "the immanent", "the omniscient", and "the transcendent"

> Where the foundations of any domain can be subsumed by three necessary and sufficient concepts, known as the modalities, so too does the relationships between these three have a consistent pattern and form. This form/pattern, common to the foundations of all domains/worlds, is described by **the three Axioms**.  
> - **Axiom I**: The immanent is more fundamental than the omniscient and/or the transcendent. The omniscient and the transcendent are conjugate.  
> - **Axiom II**: A class of the transcendent will precede an instance of the immanent. A class of the immanent will precede an instance of the omniscient. A class of the omniscient will precede an instance of the transcendent.  
> - **Axiom III**: The (classes/instances) of the immanent, omniscient, and transcendent are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable.

> The notion of 'real/reality' is defined, and has its basis in (only) change, causality, and choice.
> - **Causality** is defined as the subjective perception (context) of a consistency between two objective contents.
> - **Choice** is defined as the objective expression (content) of a consistency between two subjective contexts.
> - **Change** refers to the continuity of content and asymmetry of context of the interaction/definition of the subjective and objective.
> 
**Change** has the nature of the immanent modality.  
**Causality** has the nature of the omniscient modality.  
**Choice** has the nature of the transcendent modality.

> There really is not that much involved in establishing Incommensuration. In being rather basic, there are not that many points involved, and each of them seems fairly self evident. The basic skeleton is as follows:.  
> - 1; the idea that every measurement is a comparison.  
> - 2; the idea that comparison, as a concept, has the six named necessary and sufficient intrinsics.  
> - 3; that the definitions of symmetry, continuity, etc, are well mapped to the actual deep usages of those terms.  
> - 4; that the notions of content/context, sameness/difference, etc, are inherently inseperable.  
> - 5; that the essence of QM and GR are fundamentally expressed in terms of symmetry, continuity, etc.

- Immanent, Omnicient, Trancendental
- Creation, Existance, Interaction
- Sensed, Knowing, Being


Ontology and Epistemology.
- Meaning, Values, Purpose.
- Choice, Change, Causation.

Life
- Conscious, sustainable, and evolving
- Consicous/unconscious, individual/group, actual/patential

Determinism = all content values can be specified = Content/Context.
- Pattern (mass), force, probabiltiy = Content 
- Time, Space, Possibility = Context

> **How are modality correspondences identified?**
> ---
> To effectively identify those concepts which are the modes of an arbitrarily given domain, it is necessary to establish that the selected concepts are exactly essential to that domain (i.e., to have selected the correct number or quantity of concept), and that well developed (tested) role correspondences have been observed for each (i.e., to have selected the correct quality of concept).  
> 
> Often this is a process of iterative trial and error, where conceptual aspects of a given domain are abstracted and tested against the modal templates for a good fit. To show correctness, each of the abstracted concepts needs to be demonstrated as being necessary to any possible consideration of the domain, and that the three concepts together are sufficient for any such consideration (being careful to have well scoped domains). Then, the role of each of the concepts with respect to the other two is considered in detail, particularly as they are used in careful (complete) descriptions of the process of the domain being considered. Where both the implicit connotations and strict lexical formulation of all such descriptive statements remain correct when substituting instances of terms of equivalent modality for some other domain, then the modalities of each of the three domain essential terms is said to be well associated.
> 
> Ultimately, it is the Axioms which define and distinguish the modalities, even while the Axioms are best described in the terms of the modalities. To consider the (meaning of) Axioms as being defined/described in terms of (the meaning of) the modalities is the practice of theory. To consider the Axioms as defining/describing (the meaning of) the modalities is the theory of practice. To know and understand the IM requires both the practice of theory and the theory of practice.

> **How do you use the Axioms to distinguish the modalities?**
> ---
> Each of the Axioms defines a pattern of relationships (in a given context). If you can match the roles that each of the modal concepts has with respect to the other two, in terms of these common patterns, then the correspondences themselves become fixed.  
> 
> **Axiom III** is an assertion that there are three modalities, or three terms/concepts, which together subsume the essence of a domain, and which fill (or have) the roles of the modalities of immanent, omniscient, and transcendent. Axiom III does not in itself identify which domain essential concept is associated with which modality, but only that such associations are always strongly definable.  
> 
> **Axiom I** distinguishes the immanent modality from the omniscient and transcendent modalities. The immanent modality is that term which (in a context which is both objective and non-temporal) is used as the necessary basis for the definition/description of both the omniscient and the transcendent terms, and/or that which can only be (completely/accurately) defined/described in terms of both the omniscient and the transcendent terms. Axiom I has the effect of naming/identifying the term with an immanent modal association, even though it does not identify which of the two remaining terms are to be associated with the omniscient and transcendent modalities.  
> 
> **Axiom II** distinguishes the omniscient modality from the transcendent modality. The omniscient modal term is identified by being that term which in practice (in a context which is both subjective and temporal) necessarily follows from the being of the term with an immanent modal association (that term already identified by Axiom I). The transcendent modal term is identified by being that term which in practice necessarily precedes the being of the term with an immanent modal association.

> **An immanent modal concept** is that concept which, in the context of theory, has the role of either defining **both** of the other two concepts, or which can only be fully defined by statements in terms of both of the other two concepts in a theoretical/model context domain external to the domain so described and modeled.  
> 
> _In the context of practice_, the immanent modality will be that aspect of all instances of the domain fundamental dynamic which subjectively follows (in time) the occurrence of a transcendental aspect and which precedes an omniscient aspect.  
> 
> _In the context of metaphysics_, the immanent modal concept will be the one which has a pattern of the structure of its relations which most closely match that of Axiom II.  
  
> **An omniscient modal concept** is that concept which, in the context of theory, has the role of referring to that which is a (known/necessary) static (fixed) consequent to/of a class of the processes described by, or referred to by, the immanent modal concept in the action context of process within a domain.  
> 
> _In the context of practice_, the omniscient modality will be that aspect of all instances of the domain fundamental dynamic which subjectively follows (in time) the occurrence of an immanent aspect and which precedes a transcendent aspect.  
> 
> _In the context of metaphysics_, the omniscient modal concept will be the one which has a pattern of the structure of its relations which most closely match that of Axiom I.  
  
> **A transcendent modal concept** is that concept which, in the context of theory, has the role of referring to the (unspecified or incompletely specified) class of implicit assumptions/process which is/are a necessary precondition(s) to the class of processes described by, or referred to by, the immanent modal concept in the action context of process within a domain.  
> 
> _In the context of practice_, the transcendent modality will be that aspect of all instances of the domain fundamental dynamic which subjectively follows (in time) the occurrence of an omniscient aspect and which precedes an immanent aspect.  
> 
> _In the context of metaphysics_, the transcendent modal concept will be the one which has a pattern of the structure of its relations which most closely match that of Axiom III.

### Recommendations

> harshcopywriter - The best book I've read on metaphysics and ontology (what exists, and in what ways is it reasonable for us to look for meaning in what exists) is Ladyman & Ross, 'Every Thing Must Go'. It's quite philosophically technical but I'm not sure it's possible to engage with these issues without some technicality.
