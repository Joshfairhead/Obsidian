#### Quotes
In Reinventing Discovery by Michael Nielsen, Nielsen describes his vision of **The Era of Networked Science** (emphasis added):

> I believe that the process of science—how discoveries are made—will change more in the next twenty years than it has in the past 300 years.

> When the history of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries is written, we’ll see this as the time in history when the world’s information was transformed from an inert, passive state, and put into a unified system that brings that information alive.

> **We are reinventing discovery, and the result will be a new era of networked science that speeds up discovery, not in one small corner of science, but across all of science. That reinvention will deepen our understanding of how the universe works and help us address our most critical human problems.**
