# Decision Making
AKA [[Ethics]] 

> One chooses most effectively when choosing (and continuing to choose) from one's deepest basis of desire. The best choices express that desire in a manner which is affirming to all of life at all levels of being.

> One's actions, interactions, and expressions in a world have maximum effectiveness when equal attention is given to: 1) the intensity, 2) the feeling, and 3) the forms of the conscious choices which compose them.
