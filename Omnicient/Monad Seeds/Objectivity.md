> To consider metaphysics is to consider the question "What is the relation between 'the world out there' and my experience of it?".  
>
> A core aspect of the question is "what is required in one's subjective experience for one to regard something as objective, and therefore as being 'real' and external to one's perceptions of it?".
>
> In answering this latter question, (and in this way, providing some clarity about _what_ is considered 'real'), the following three (subjective) metrics (aspects of all experience) are to be considered:.
>
>- **The degree of the 'intensity'**: the intensity of one's experience relative to other experiences of the self.  
>
>- **The degree of 'consistency'**: the degree that aspects of the experience can be formed into 'closed consistent rings'.  
>
>- **The degree of 'novelty'**: the degree that the experience is potentially surprising, unpredictable, or novel relative to all the subjectively prior experiences of the self.
>
> Novel and unpredictable behavior is a necessary criterion to distinguish 'reality' from 'a simulation of reality'. To declare that there is something independent of one's own mind is to ascribe to it properties and characteristics that are not of one's self, in order to make it different than the self.

> **Absolute and total precognition leads directly to a sense of unreality.**
