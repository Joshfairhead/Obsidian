# Revathi Call 20-12-21

### Looking forward
There is a desire to move faster towards key goals which were previously unmet. On reflection I wonder if this is perhaps better thought of as more transparency/visibility about the movement towards our goals and the clarity of them? 

This naturally leads to questions around how metrics and goals fit within the organisation. Two heuristics that come to mind; 1) that which is not measured is not managed. 2) Goodharts law whereby when a measure becomes a metric it ceases to be a reliable measure. There are many questions to be answered here: What kinds are ok? How should and shouldnt they be used? What can we understand from Alfie Kohen and Carrol Sanfords research on rewards and feedback? 

More concretely we discussed a desire for strategy workshops in January along with their structure and the format. To help clarify and navigate uncertainties my proposal and offer was to run a three horizons workshop: https://resources.h3uni.org/tutorial/three-horizons/ for the endaoment and governance circles to help kick things off. 

Roles was a consideration point that ties into the above; having articulated a shared sense of direction, domains of responsibility can be clarified and with them roles will follow. This is probably best as a second workshop.

There was also mention of formally creating a general circle according to the notes I made in call but I'm unsure what this means or if we discussed the matter further.


### Open questions
- What are Carol Sanfords 3 key principals?
- What did we mean by formally creating a general circle?
