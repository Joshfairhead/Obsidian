Regen Foundation’s Delegation Strategy for Mainnet With Regen Ledger going live in a few days, we at Regen Foundation understand the gravity of the responsibility resting with our organization. We have been weighing a number of complex factors as part of preparing our delegations for mainnet.  The Community-First Principle As an entity with a charitable mission explicitly […]

> Regen Foundation Board President Will Szal: 
>
> _Regen Foundation’s first order of business will be to implement and iterate on our Community Staking DAOs architecture—a Proof-of-Stake variant that extends network governance to community members such as land stewards, landscapes, scientists, and developers. Between our Founding Executive Director, Revathi, and our Board—spanning the_ [_OpenTEAM_](https://openteam.community)_,_ [_Gnosis_](https://gnosis.io)_, and_ [_Buckminster Fuller Institute_](https://www.bfi.org) _communities—we’re off to a strong start._

### 1. Scientific Research and Inquiry
- The Foundation aims to facilitate and nurture an open and collaborative process that supports the science needed for the Regen Network to produce scientifically robust, context specific protocols for the verification of ecological outcomes worldwide.
- We are committed to open source and  believe that helping develop open and shared protocols are a key driver for the acceleration of planetary regeneration and a re-establishment of a healthy commons.

### 2. Education and Capacity Building
Regen Foundation also aims to enable the global agricultural and technological communities to learn, understand, and co-create the educational network needed to make ecological agriculture accessible and make a larger climate impact. We aim to help the agricultural community have easy access to scientifically validated practices and processes leading to robust environmental resilience. 

### 3. Technological Tools for the Commons
Regen Foundation helps facilitate and nurture the socio-technological infrastructure to ensure the future of Regen Network and Regen Ledger are decentralized and democratic. We envision convening the open source community and coordinating work on critical  elements of decentralized governance and computing in the domain of ecological regeneration.

[When to Vote? - Regen Foundation](https://regen.foundation/when-to-vote/)

Photo by stefan moertl on Unsplash Regen Ledger has begun the process of its first two network governance proposals. The first proposal concerns REGEN transfers (transfers within Regen Ledger). The second proposal concerns IBC transfers (transfers between Cosmos-based chains). At this inflection point in network maturity, it is worth reflecting on the culture and process […]

TL/DR: Regen Foundation will delay its August 5mm c-REGEN delegation from the Community Staking DAO allocation in order to allow adequate time for community governance to upgrade the delegation strategy in light of the expanded validator set. Project Update To recap: Regen Ledger, a Cosmos-based blockchain for ecological contracts, launched mainnet on April 15th of […]

Upgrading the Community Staking DAO Allocation Delegation Strategy TL;DR—After opening up the question to community input, Regen Foundation will be expanding its delegation policy for the next 10mm REGEN delegated to include the 25 new validators in the set. On August 8th, Regen Ledger’s validator set was increased from 50 to 75, via governance vote […]

TL;DR: Regen Network Development, Inc. and Regen Foundation no longer have crossover in personnel. Since our inception, Regen Network has been committed to decentralization. Today marks an inflection point on this path. I have resigned from the Board of Directors at Regen Network Development, Inc. (“RND”) and Gregory Landua, CEO at RND, has resigned as […]

[Set the Validator Minimum Commission Rate to 5%?](https://forum.regen.network/t/set-the-validator-minimum-commission-rate-to-5/316)

Hi Everyone, I’m Pete, I run the Regenerator Validator. I might be shooting myself in the foot (my Validator’s Commission Rate being set at 2%) but I feel for the benefit of the Network it’s worth having a minimum commission rate of 3-5%. This will help provide network stability and stop 0% validators driving commissions down. It also ensures Validators are earning enough to support secure and stable validation. My initial thought was that a rate of 3% would be a good starting point but afte...

[Community Grants](https://forum.regen.network/t/community-grants/267)

In discussion about the Cosmos Ecosystem Allocation discussion, the fact has arisen that Regen Network has a Community Pool that is continually growing via block rewards. @corlock has shared information about how to query the pool. This pool currently has a little over 2mm REGEN. So, what do we want to fund through grants? This is the forum to discuss!

[Cosmos Ecosystem Allocation](https://forum.regen.network/t/cosmos-ecosystem-allocation/259)

Back in our whitepaper, we stated the 3mm REGEN (wallet address here) would be allocated for “airdrop or work-lock” to ATOM holders. Our intention here has always been to reinforce mutual value with the Cosmos community and fuel the vision of the internet of blockchains. Earlier this year, 200,984 REGEN of this allocation went into an airdrop, but the rest have been reserved in case the community feels there is a better way that these tokens could be used. The space has shifted a lot since 2018 ...

Hello Regenerates, The Regen Network Development (RND) team is gearing up for the release of Regen Ledger v2.0, which will include the first version of the ecocredit module on Regen Mainnet. This first version of the ecocredit module will be permissioned, meaning only accounts approved through an on-chain governance process will have the authority to create credit classes. The list of approved credit class designers will be an on-chain parameter that will require a parameter change proposal in ...

We’d like to begin a strategy of staking these tokens, and are going to outline our strategy below. Please use the following two weeks as a public comment period before we implement. There are a number of factors that we’ve been weighing in considering how to approach this pool. Below I’ll go through, point by point, on a number o...
