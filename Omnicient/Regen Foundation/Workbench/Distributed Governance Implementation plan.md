### Image Description:

Two different colored circles are connected to each other with an double-headed arrow pointing in each direction. On the top is a slightly bigger circle, the general circle, which holds the general aim of the organization. On the bottom is the slightly darker shaded and slightly smaller circle, the mission circle, which holds the organization true to its mission. Within the mission circle is a yet smaller, yet darker shaded circle with a dotted line, that represents the board of directors, a selected subset of the mission circle. In it we can see labels referring to the specific roles required in the board: the secretary, the treasurer, and the Adult and Youth Board Chairs. The double-headed arrow that connects the mission and general circle reads “executive directors” as they are to perform as double links between those two circles
