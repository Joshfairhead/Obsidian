# Revathi Call 20-12-21

### Looking forward
There is a desire to move faster towards key goals, or perhaps for more transparency/visibility about the movement towards those goals. This naturally leads to questions around how metrics fit in? What kinds are ok? How should they be used? 



Strategy for Immediate things in January
Ask Will about Carrol Sanfords 3
Start curating resources around gov circle

Formally creating a general circle
Workshop for the governance and general circle
Set up two dedicated sessions about [[Regen Governance Circle Index]]

Endaoment > where we are where we are going (3 horizons)
- Sort out workshop as a lab
- Description of the framework
- What we want to do
- What people should read beforehand
- Length of time, follow up workshops etc.

Endaoment -> team roles 
Look through Endaoment section in preparation for roles and horizon mapping

Start a slack conversation to find time for initial gov circle three horizons
