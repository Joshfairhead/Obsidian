# Revathi Call 20-12-21

### Looking forward
There is a desire to move faster towards key goals which were previously unmet. I question if this is perhaps better thought of as more transparency/visibility about the movement towards those goals and the clarity of them? This naturally leads to questions around how metrics fit What kinds are ok? How should they be used? How should they not be used? How do they relate with Alfie Kohen and Carrol Sanfords research on rewards and feedback?

We discussed a desire for strategy workshops in January along with their structure and the format. To help clarify and navigate uncertainties my proposal and offer was to run a three horizons workshop: https://resources.h3uni.org/tutorial/three-horizons/ for the endaoment and governance circles to help kick us off. 





Strategy for Immediate things in January
Ask Will about Carrol Sanfords 3
Start curating resources around gov circle

Formally creating a general circle
Workshop for the governance and general circle
Set up two dedicated sessions about [[Regen Governance Circle Index]]

Endaoment -> where we are where we are going (3 horizons)
- Sort out workshop as a lab
- Description of the framework
- What we want to do
- What people should read beforehand
- Length of time, follow up workshops etc.

Endaoment -> team roles 
Look through Endaoment section in preparation for roles and horizon mapping

Start a slack conversation to find time for initial gov circle three horizons
