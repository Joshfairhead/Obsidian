# Regen Governance Circle Index

## Why
- Governance is an organisational meta-function prefigured by initial conditions.
- The shape a network or organisation takes depends upon the wholeness of individual participants and the frameworks in which they are embedded. 
- Any choice of framework impacts all future decisions and so we should be mindful of unintendend consequences. 
- The purpose of a Governace circle is thus to determine and implement the processes and frameworks with the least constraints while remaining in accordance with the scope of the networks values. In a world of rising complexity, this is necessary for organisational adaptability and survival, let alone planetary Regeneration. 

 
## How
- Articulating values and ethics at the individual and collective levels
- Taking accountability for ourselves and our decisions
- Making sure we are equipped to deal with the terrain. 
	- Maps, compasses, vehicle. 
	- Coordination


## What 
- Three horizons to articulate our present terrain and future destination (map)
- Workshops focused on ethics and sense-making (compass)
- Circles and roles to coordinate shared responsibilities and accounting for them (vehicle)
