# Regen Governance Circle Index

## Why
- Governance is an organisational meta-function prefigured by initial conditions.
- The shape an instantiation takes within an organisation or across a network depends upon the wholeness of individual participants and the frameworks in which they are embedded. 
- The purpose of a Governace circle is thus to determine and implement processes and frameworks in accordance with the scope of the networks values. 
- The initial choice of framework limits all other choices
 
## How
- Articulating values and ethics at the individual and collective levels
- Taking accountability for ourselves and our decisions
- Making sure we are equipped to deal with the terrain. 
	- Maps, compasses, vehicle. 
	- Coordination


## What 
- Three horizons to articulate our present terrain and future destination (map)
- Workshops focused on ethics and sense-making (compass)
- Circles and roles to coordinate shared responsibilities and accounting for them (vehicle)
