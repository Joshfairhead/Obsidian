# Regen Governance Circle Index

## Why
- Governance is an organisational meta-function prefigured by initial conditions. The purpose of the Governace circle is to determine meta-processes and frameworks that support the networks values of regeneration in a congruent and embodied way. 
- There are catches:
	- Any choice of governance framework that gets implemented impacts all future decisions of an organisation. The precautionary principle applies; we should move slowly, plant things and foster healthy growth.
	- All categories (frames) are exclusionary. In order to serve the networks very broad goals we can determine that any framework implemented needs to span a number of properties; integrity, flexibility, openness, etc. so as to include a plurality of values diverse enough for planetary regeneration:
		- Regeneration
		- Inclusion
		- Collaboration
		- Openness and transparency
		- Continuous growth
- In all actuality human variety and diversity is 'computaitonally irreducible' and so any framework should be considered a descriptive (rather than prescriptive) language. We are thus trying to find a lingua franca that can frame any 
 
## How
- 
- Articulating values and ethics at the individual and collective levels
- Taking accountability for ourselves and our decisions
- Making sure we are equipped to deal with the terrain. 
	- Maps, compasses, vehicle. 
	- Coordination


## What 
- Aiming for 
- Three horizons to articulate our present terrain and future destination (map)
- Workshops focused on ethics and sense-making (compass)
- Circles and roles to coordinate shared responsibilities and accounting for them (vehicle)
