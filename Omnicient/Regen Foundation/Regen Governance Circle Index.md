# Regen Governance Circle Index

## Why
- Governance is an organisational meta-function prefigured by initial conditions. The purpose of the Governace circle is to determine meta-processes and frameworks that support the networks values of regeneration in a congruent and embodied way. 
- There are catches:
	- Any choice of governance framework that gets implemented impacts all future decisions of an organisation. The precautionary principle applies; we should move slowly, plant things and foster the healthy growth of network constituients (the soil from which the network grows).
	- All categories (frames) are exclusionary. In order to serve the networks very broad goals we can determine that any framework implemented needs to span a number of properties; integrity, flexibility, openness, etc. so as to include a plurality of values diverse enough for planetary regeneration. The following are values are taken from Notion:
		- Regeneration
		- Inclusion
		- Collaboration
		- Openness and transparency
		- Continuous growth
- In all actuality human variety and diversity is 'computaitonally irreducible' and so any framework should be considered a descriptive (rather than prescriptive) language. We are thus trying to find a lingua franca or meta-framework that can integrate all perspectives and existing frameworks. 
 
## How
- If governance is a meta-function of an organisation that determines processess and frameworks, we need to examine the meta-process by which selection itself is made and its appropriacy. 



- Science. This term is often misconstrued to mean 'Baconian Science' which is a valid methodology for interpreting the objective and observable world of stuff and things. However this form of science is reductive and doesn't take into account "other ways of knowing"; it is a particular methodology derrived from and constrained by metaphysical assumptions.  

-  So we must ask what kind of science is appropriate to the being-ness and will of the network? 


- Extitutionally
- Trust
- 


- Articulating values and ethics at the individual and collective levels
- Taking accountability for ourselves and our decisions
- Making sure we are equipped to deal with the terrain. 
	- Maps, compasses, vehicle. 
	- Coordination
