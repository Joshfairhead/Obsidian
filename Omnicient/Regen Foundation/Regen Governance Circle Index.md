# Regen Governance Circle Index

## Why
- Governance is an organisational meta-function prefigured by initial conditions. The purpose of the Governace circle is thus to determine processes and frameworks to support the networks values of regeneration in a congruent and embodied way. 
- Any choice of governance framework impacts all future decisions of an organisation. 
- In order to serve the networks very broad goals we can determine that any framework implemented needs to include a number of properties; integrity, flexibility, openness, etc.
- 
 
## How
- Articulating values and ethics at the individual and collective levels
- Taking accountability for ourselves and our decisions
- Making sure we are equipped to deal with the terrain. 
	- Maps, compasses, vehicle. 
	- Coordination


## What 
- Aiming for 
- Three horizons to articulate our present terrain and future destination (map)
- Workshops focused on ethics and sense-making (compass)
- Circles and roles to coordinate shared responsibilities and accounting for them (vehicle)
