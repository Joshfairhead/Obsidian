- [Carrol Sanford: No more feedback](https://carolsanford.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CarolSanford_Sample.pdf). Much resonance with her words and feel the essence of what shes talking about is an "ableness to be" for ones expressive capacity. I'd like to know more about her three core concepts; this sounds likely to be an instance of fundemental triplication. 

Carrol Sanfords three core concepts form "above the line thinking; living systems mind":
- Avoid Ideals, standards, patterns to follow; they commoditise life
- Every whole has an ESSENCE that is being revealed and is in a state of evolution (pattern generating). Be a resource to ESSENCE evolution.
- Starting point is "GIVING LIFE" rather than "ARRESTING DISORDER" as framing work
