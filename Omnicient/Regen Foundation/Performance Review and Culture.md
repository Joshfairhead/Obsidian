Carrol Sanfords three core concepts form "above the line thinking; living systems mind":
- Avoid Ideals, standards, patterns to follow; they commoditise life
- Every whole has an ESSENCE that is being revealed and is in a state of evolution (pattern generating). Be a resource to ESSENCE evolution.
- Starting point is "GIVING LIFE" rather than "ARRESTING DISORDER" as framing work
