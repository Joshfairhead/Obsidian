# Three Horizons Mapping

[Scoping](https://resources.h3uni.org/facilitation-guide/scoping/)

## Preliminary definitions of scope for exploration:

### Endaoment Circle (function?)
- To ensure under represented communities have a voice in the Regen network through an equitable and just token distribution, and to build relationships with these communtites. 

### General Circle (being?)
- To discern organisational needs, hopes, dreams and desires which inform its strategy and the formation of new domain specific circles.

### Governance Circle (will?)
- To discern general organisational frameworks that maintain adaptive ability





## Notes
S3 Domains: 
> A domain is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision making  
within an organization. 

> Inadequately defined domains typically lead to stakeholders having different  
assumptions about areas of responsibility and autonomy.

> The domain’s primary driver - the main driver the delegatee(s)  
respond to: 
	- the set of subdrivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to the domain’s primary driver, which include:  
		– key responsibilities (any driver following directly from the domain’s primary driver)  
		– dependencies and external constraints (drivers relating to other domains or to the environment beyond the organization) that constrain the delegatees’ autonomy
