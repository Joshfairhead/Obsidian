# Three Horizons Mapping

[Scoping](https://resources.h3uni.org/facilitation-guide/scoping/)

## Preliminary definitions of scope for exploration:

### Governance Circle
**Primary Driver**
- To discern and develop organisational frameworks in line with the network vision:
	- Cultivating the growth of regenerative agriculture, holistic land management, and marine stewardship through the development of technological tools, scientific inquiry, and capacity building.

**Secondary Drivers**
- 

**Dependencies and external constraints:**
- Accountability to the mission circle and board of directors?

### General Circle (function)
**Primary Driver**
- To discern organisational needs, hopes, dreams and desires which inform its strategy and the formation of new domain specific circles. Operations.

**Secondary Drivers**
- 

**Dependencies and external constraints:**
- Accountability to the mission circle and board of directors?

### Endaoment Circle (function)
**Primary Driver**
- To ensure under represented communities have a voice in the Regen network through an equitable and just token distribution, and to build relationships with these communtites. 

**Dependencies and external constraints:**
- ??



## Notes
>Governance in an organization (or a domain within it) is the process of setting objectives and making and evolving decisions that guide people towards achieving those objectives. 
>
>Operations is doing the work and organizing day-to-day activities within  
the constraints defined through governance.


S3 Domains: 
> A domain is a distinct area of influence, activity and decision making  
within an organization. Inadequately defined domains typically lead to stakeholders having different assumptions about areas of responsibility and autonomy.

> The domain’s primary driver - the main driver the delegatee(s) respond to: 
	- the set of subdrivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to the domain’s primary driver, which include:  
		– key responsibilities (any driver following directly from the domain’s primary driver)  
		– dependencies and external constraints (drivers relating to other domains or to the environment beyond the organization) that constrain the delegatees’ autonomy
		
		
		
		
Governance
- Team gainig clarity on domains and roles
- The organisation and its incentives and rewards structure
- The board
