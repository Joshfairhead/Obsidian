### Notes
> As decentralized communities of practice lack the coercive power which defines centralizing institutions, their continued existence relies entirely on the voluntary participation of members, and therefore necessitates an institutional structure facilitating and incentivizing participation.

>Roughly  the implementation of governance systems for commons entails:
> 1) the unambiguous definition of a problem to solve;
> 2) the construction of a community of stakeholders willing to help solve this problem;
> 3) the institution of a decision system allowing participation on an equal footing by all members of the community;
> 4) agreement on a set of rules (which are interactive and mutable with validity checksover time), which fairly reward active cooperation within the community;
> 5) the iteration of (1)-(4) at higher scales where the community as a whole is confronted with a situation requiring governance.

> [The opportunities for diffusion] encourages the decentralized adoption of standardized methodologies and languages, transparency over code and data management, and willingness to produce information of clear value to outsiders

> oken system engineering might ask questions like:
> - How are stakeholders rewarded for meaningful participation?
> - What is the value flow? Where does value start/enter? Where does value go/exit?
> - What is the value distribution, internal and external to the system of interest?
> - How does the system shape patterns of attention?

> One alternative approach for funding DeSci is the creation and maintenance of markets for projects (bounties) or the outcomes of projects such as data or intellectual property

> - Curated Funding Pools: Each donation is added to a chosen funding pool. Researchers can apply through an open protocol with their track record from early published groundwork. As new results emerge from the funded work, the NFT’s metadata is updated. 
> - Impact Tracing: Donors have a much more significant participation and visibility into the projects they helped fund. Their SFTs are a personal key to unlock a continuously-evolving experience data trail about their donation’s impact.
> - Future Participation: The NFT receipts become the key to future interactions with the scientists they supported, with evolving forms of participatory governance in the field(s) they contributed to.
> - Funding allocation: When researchers apply to one of the topic-specific funding pools, they are not coerced to reveal all their invaluable insight upfront. They simply need to share their most influential scientific work (any already-published scientific artifact they created, such as a publication, preprint, or even just a cool dataset) to a given pool. Selected scientists' works then form the basis of a growing evidence trail that is matched to the donor's minted NFT. The NFT receipts become the key to future interactions among scientists and donors, and open a universe of endless new possibilities of mutual exchange and future interactions.
