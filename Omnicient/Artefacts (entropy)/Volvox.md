### **Abstract** 
 - __Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcomes__? (1200 charecters)
	- Volvox is a personal knowledge management system based on the research of Douglas Engelbart with an intention of augmenting human capabilities and eventually building collective intelligence. Data is stored as entries in a users "Hermitage" (a GDPR compliant data vault) and linked together to create a  information ecology or "digital brain" for sorting, retrieval and remix.
	- Data is stored on a distributed hash table (Holochain) in the w3c DID standard which means that it can be shared publicly, referenced and ported across networks to contribute to the global knowledge commons. In time semantic translation and REA accounting will enable this data to become a currency of its own in the emerging knowledge economy. 
	- emergent structures to facilitate knowledge transfer
		- schema creation 
		- essential noise
		- embedded in form 
		- inter-dependence
		- buddy-guardian system to build social memory into the system
		- integration of insights
		- visual generation of links in the knowledge graph
		- tools that make humans smarter and communities more social as they use them (opposite to tools that extract the common's of wisdom)
		- Finding alignment between multi-stakeholder projects or distributed communities of practice.
				- Merge between a survey, facilitation, and sensemaking mapping.
				- Blending the work of multi stakeholder projects and digital and none-digital groups.
				- Bring well tested and respected tools to broader groups and enable discovery beyond the group space
				- Integrate with broader knowledge management tools, social graph
				- Seamless interface to facilitate group sensmaking and allow for async online collaboration.
				- Discovery of connection points, enhancement of cooperation and streamlining of working group alignment
			- **Expected Outcomes**
				- [[World Mandala]]
				- Hexagon mapping tool
				- Export to [graph format](https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/) + markdown

 __ (Optional) Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions?__
                - The team behind Volvox recently won an award for their multi-diciplinary approach at the Odyssey Hackathon on the SSI track. We also engage regularly with various initiatives across distributed spaces. 
                - Josh has previously worked on the Pillar Projects crypto wallet which was intended to turn into a "Personal Data Locker". He was considered a generalist and worked across teams on many themes; Identity, DKMS, KYC/AML, Credentials, eCommerce, Exchanges, Stable coins/[[Token Engineering]], Communications, Product, Marketing and unConferences. 
                - [[Thomas]] has been building on Holochian since the GO prototype, its now nearing maturity with the recent RSM release and he's looking forward to getting his hands dirty.
                - Martin probably has more practical experience in semantics than most people thanks to his hands on experience translating metadata at the BBC and the Sony Ericson(?) catalogues. Hes also been working on Holochain for quite some time. 
        - ###  **Requested support**
            - **Amount** €...
            - __Explain what the requested budget will be__ **used** __for? Does the project have other funding sources, both past and present? (If you want, you can in addition attach a budget at the bottom of the form)__
                - Explain costs for hardware, human labor, travel cost to technical meetings, etc.

        - ### **Compare** your own project with existing or historical efforts.
            - (e.g. what is new, more thorough or otherwise different)
            - The original method of sorting index cards pioneered by Conrad Gessner in 1556 is known as Zettelkasten and has been used extensively since. 
            - We now have tools available the likes of Roam Research and LogSeq which are essentially digital equivalents running on centralised databases. We're drawing heavily on these interfaces and updating them to run on distributed networks (CRDTs) rather than on centralised databases. We're also updating them to work with SSI standards so that artefacts created may be shared and repurposed while respecting privacy and provenience. 
            - kumu.io - tool for discovery and community sens-making. It allows a facilitator to visualize and map different dimensions of projects & social groups. However input must be captured by experienced facilitators in real life and then mapped and analyzed, the data sensmakig process thus can't be distributed. So participation in discovery is limited. Our tool could integrate well and enhance the process as the graph data export could be easily ported into Kumu
            - survey tools ?? 
        - ###  What are significant technical **challenges** you expect to solve during the project, if any?
            - Merge the facilitation, emergence and capture of data
            - Keep the solution modular (for easy integration)
            - Data portability and compatibility 
        - ###  Describe the **ecosystem** of the project, and how you will engage with relevant actors and promote the outcomes?
        - ** Attachments**: add any additional information about the project that may help us to gain more insight into the proposed effort, for instance a more detailed task description, a justification of costs or relevant endorsements. Attachments should only contain background information, please make sure that the proposal without attachments is self-contained and concise. Don't waste too much time on this. Really.
- ## Volvox thoughts 
    - RE: [Xando](https://xanadu.com/XanaduSpace/xuGzn.htm)
        - The composability of generalized media structures is a slippery slope. The rise of the alternative truth universe is somewhat enabled by it. It has no "grounding" in humanness, **if my words and information are composed of trackable bits of other sources then at what point do I take agency over it?** A [Sorites Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox) with potential for immensely dangerous consequences. But what could we do to root this immense power back into humanity and the common sanity checks of social structures, enable the good in it? [[Paradox]]
