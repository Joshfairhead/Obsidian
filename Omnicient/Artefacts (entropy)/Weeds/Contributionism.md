- **One Small Town**
- The following are key elements to establishing the first small town:
    - A population between 4000 – 7000.
    - The Mayor, Town Manager, City Council, and Sheriff are fully supportive of the mission to rejuvenate their town.
    - At least 20% of the residents express their support for the One Small Town initiative.
    - Identify the unique opportunities of the town including the agricultural and environmental possibilities that will be utilized for the benefit of the community and the investors.
    - Identify the skills and abilities of the people who have expressed their support for initiative as an indicator for launching new projects.
    - Analyze the existing factories and industry (some of which may be dormant) to strategically plan for new projects and businesses to launch in the community.
    - Funding is needed to create and renovate manufacturing facilities, equipment, tools, and supplies to create a wide range of products and services.
    - Detailed business plans to offer investors a truly unique opportunity to help the town rejuvenate rapidly. We call it “Adopt a Small Town”
- This is a truly unique investment opportunity in which the investor will have the following benefits not normally associated with the capitalist model: "Full support of the whole community.
- "No hostile competition from other businesses."
- "Free labor from the community participation in all the community projects. This is also a unique funding opportunity for conscious millionaires who care about their hometowns and want to save them from further decay." 
- "Successful businesses, currently in the town, are encouraged to help support the One Small Town initiative by investing in other project/business plans that help achieve the town’s self-sustainable goals and generate a profit for the investor."
- "Every new community project/business will have a strategically chosen project manager; master craftsman or expert in that specific area; and a small group of skilled workers in that field. These appointed workers will be paid normal salaries as the backbone of that business. The rest of the labor will come from the community contribution." 
- "Every person who contributes 3 hours per week towards community projects receives their share of the benefits from all the projects. This provides a simple solution during the initial transition phase. Everyone can keep their jobs and continue with their lives as normal, but make themselves available for their 3-hour community work every week."
- "The weekly contribution work will be assigned by a central project manager. In exchange for the 3-hour contribution, every participant receives free goods and services from all the community projects."
- "The town produces 3x the needs of the community, in all that we grow or produce."
    - One third is retained for the contributing community members who receive their share of all the goods and services at no cost.
    - The other two thirds are sold to non-community members and other distribution sources at fair or below market prices.
    - The profits are distributed back to the community as such:
    - 1/3 of the profits goes towards the investor; 1/3 goes to the community bank; and 1/3 goes to the contributing members
    - of the community as personal income.
