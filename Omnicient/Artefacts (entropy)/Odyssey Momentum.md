        - [Mega brief](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lfkZwqY=/)
        - Judges:
            - Challenge lead
            - Budget holder / representative of the Challenge Lead organization
            - Budget holder / representative of a stakeholder organization
        - Points (0-5)
            - Ecosystem Aligment
                - The Team ability to collaborate with stakeholders and change there own ideas based on stakeholder input. 
                - The Team’s ability to grow this challenge ecosystem. 
            - Pilot Support
                - Enthusiasm and clarity to invest time and money within my stakeholder group for this Team’s specific problem\/solution.
                - Can we start testing within 6 months? If not, we have to be honest, this Teams proposal is not an opportunity, it’s a trap.
            - Solution/Prototype
                - Does the prototype work?
                - Is this a breakthrough? (What can we do now, because of this solution, that we couldn’t do before? How will it potentially change the system?)
            - Team Wow factor
                - How exciting are you to continue working with this team? (and would you invite others to join a pilot project with them?)
    - Bounties
        - **Angle 1 – The Adoption Driver**
            - Ensuring the best adoption of an SSI-implementation for the end users of other Odyssey challenges. These can be one of our suggestions or a challenge not listed here:
                - City of the Hague – [Driving adoption of living labs](https://www.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-the-hague-challenge-driving-adoption-of-living-labs/)
                - Vattenfall – [Future proof infrastructure for smart meter data](https://www.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-vattenfall-challenge-future-proof-infrastructure-for-smart-meter-data/)
                - Groningen – [The future of acute healthcare](https://www.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-groningen-challenge-the-future-of-acute-healthcare/)
            - Collaborate with the teams, the challenge leads and the challenge stakeholders of other challenges to demonstrate the feasibility of SSI-adoption in real-life settings and follow-up pilots from these challenges.
        - **Angle 2 – The Multidisciplinary Process**
            - How will we enable the process for SSI on non-technical aspects? This includes
                - Build the policy construct – how might we enable SSI-policy within the context of international and local policies? How might we overcome the legal barriers to make an SSI framework a reality?
                - Build the human construct – how might we create a culture of trust and user friendly SSI as a desirable and realistic alternative societal concept?
                - Build the governance construct – how might we design the entity that will successfully govern SSI  without becoming a new central power?
        - **Angle 3 – Interoperability Development**
            - There will not be a single technical solution for all identity needs. Therefore we aim to see teams demonstrating interoperability between different building blocks of the SSI Sandbox or connecting multiple challenges in a technology [[Agnostic]] way.
        - **Angle 4 – The Open Call**
            - Surprise us! Come up with a genuine new idea! New proposition, way of working or technical solution?
            - For inspiration we suggest looking at the Nature 2.0, [[Opening up real estate]] and Sovereign Nature challenges, can you come up with the SSI variant of thinking outside the box?

            [x] [Figma Slides](https://www.figma.com/file/7Wz4svgdU1vSkTZxp4eio7/Momentum?node-id=1%3A2)
            emailed to: checkin@odyssey.org
            explanation of your solution in **three slides**
                - Slide 1: What opportunity do you present? What problem are you solving in which way, why is your solution the way to go and what is it’s potential.
                    - [ ] What opportunity do you present? What problem are you solving (NEEDS) in which way (APPROACH),  why is yr solution the way to go (BENEFITS )and what is it's potential (COMPETITION))?
                - Slide 2: Any important part you choose to elaborate on (tech, legal, interoperability, collaborations with other projects that are strengthening yours) 
                    -  [ ] Any important part we choose to elaborate on? (tech. legal, ) >> COMPETITION (what makes us special and irresistible)
                - Slide 3:  Pilot Support .Your pilot project. How much is already good to go? What will it deliver to who and what do stakeholders need to do and invest to make it happen?
