# Mutual Credit Use Cases

- Use cases
    - Cooking
    - Cleaning
- Edge cases
    - When guests clean the house and someone is missing, does the missing party  go into negative credits?
        - e.g. Two people clean the house one doesnt
    - How do we account for with common use in a fluid group?
        - New membranes, select membranes...
    - Can projects accumulate debt? 
        - Investment for future product
    - Intrinsic vs Extrinsic needs/wants; I want to do something thats good for me and others (e.g. learning to build stuff on Holochain), but if everyone does that the dirty work gets left behind (toilet cleaning)
- Open questions
    - when value is created, does it need to be nulled? i.e. who do we take hay credits from?... projects
    - Should we include exchange rates?
        - Should exchange rates be dynamic
    - Do we discount learning? 
        - Intrinsic vs Extrinsic needs/wants; I want to do something thats good for me and others (e.g. learning to build stuff on Holochain), but if everyone does that the dirty work gets left behind (toilet cleaning)
        - Learning generates intrinsic value which can be passed on to others; e.g. water filter
    - Four quadrants mutual credit? Objective measurement, subjective valuation?
        - Can there be inverse ratios between singular/collective subjective valuations?
            - e.g. Whats a DAO talk, I felt like my time was wasted! Cultural
            - e..g. I'm pissy and the context needs me not to be; should meditation/relaxation be valued by the group?
