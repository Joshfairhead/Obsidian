# WeQuest
- WeQuest is a Decentralized Application designed to help people connect with each other, to exchange goods and to provide services without the need for money. Neighbouring providers will be able to fulfil the requests, in return of time credits, karma and reputation points for the quality provided. They can then use these credits to request services from others.
