    - **LEDGER** is looking for SMEs, teams, organisations and researchers that want to shift data management, leveraging on decentralised algorithms based on blockchains, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and/or peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies to address Privacy-by-Design, reliability, trustworthiness and openness to build human centric solutions.
    - **Summary/outline of process**
        - Proposals should address specific social or industrial challenges related to one or more of the application domains or challenges, defined within the Strategic Research and Innovation Work Programme.
        - Proposals should explicitly address a research component related to the topic of Decentralized Data Governance, Resulting MVPs and services should be able to provide a significant improvement in terms of data sovereignty for end users, and
        - The results of the bottom-up projects should be compliant with Free and [[Open Source]] Licences (i.e. Open Source Hardware, Free and Open Source Software).
        - LEDGER will only support bottom-up projects that will commit to generate Open Knowledge as result of their projects in the shape of free and Open Source software, and Open Source hardware” and “Open Access” accordingly with the nature of the result, being software, hardware of other intangible piece of knowledge (i.e. research paper).
        - Though teams could submit multiple applications, neither team member nor any legal entity can be funded twice by LEDGER. In the case more than one proposal with any similar team members or from the same organisation will be
among the 16 selected projects only the one with more points will be funded.
        - Only proposals submitted through the Open Call submission tool at https://ledger-2nd-opencall.fundingbox.com/ and within the Call duration will be accepted. Proposals submitted by any other means, will not be evaluated.

    - **Scoring framework**
        - For each section, the minimum threshold is 3 out of 5 points. The default overall threshold, applying to the sum of the three individual scores, is 12.
        - 0 = Proposal fails to address the criterion or cannot be assessed due to missing or incomplete information.
        - 1 = Poor: criterion is inadequately addressed or there are serious inherent weaknesses.
        - 2 = Fair: proposal broadly addresses the criterion, but there are significant weaknesses.
        - 3 = Good: proposal addresses the criterion well, but a number of shortcomings are present.
        - 4 = Very good: proposal addresses the criterion very well, but a small number of shortcomings are
present.
        - 5 = Excellent: proposal successfully addresses all relevant aspects of the criterion. Anyshortcomings are minor.
    - **Excellence**
        - **Ambition**: The applicants are invited to demonstrate to what extent the proposed experiment is beyond the State of the Art related with the application of privacy by design and decentralized data governance in the operational environment targeted by the experiment and describe the
innovative approach behind it __(e.g. ground-breaking objectives, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models__). The applicants need to also demonstrate to what extent the proposed experiment leverages on a research component related
with the topic of Decentralised Data Governance.
        - **Innovation:** applicants have to provide information about the level of innovation within the vertical selected and about the degree of differentiation that this experiment will bring. This should include he definition of concrete performance targets in one or several of the domains described in this
Open Call. Moreover, the proposal should state how these performance targets will be achieved.
        - **Soundness of the approach:** Applicants have to contribute premises of the proposed ideas.
        - **Cross-value chain approach:** The applicants have to provide concrete and verifiable arguments, and/or evidences, regarding to what extent the proposed project will rely upon, or will contribute to, the collaboration and integration of different innovation actors (for instance, by including large
enterprises, SMEs, public authorities, and research organizations)
    - **Impact**
        - **Market opportunity:** The applicants are invited to demonstrate a clear idea of what they want to do and whether the new/improved product has market potential, e.g. because it solves a problem for a specific target customer base.

        - **Reusability potential and contribution to grow Free and Open source hardware and software ecosystems:** The applicants have to provide information about how the experiment might contribute to provide new building blocks (applications, algorithms, among others) that might help to grow Free and open source hardware and software ecosystems. 
        - **IPR Management3:**The applicants need to demonstrate how they will comply with the openness principle by addressing free and open source Hardware and Software.
    - **Implementation**
        - **Team:** The applicants have to provide details about their management and leadership qualities; their ability to take a concept from ideas to market; their capacity to carry through their ideas and understand the dynamics of the market they are trying to tap into. The team should be balanced, cross-functional, and fully dedicated to the project and with a strong background and skill base. __The applicants must demonstrate how they will comply with the multidisciplinary principle of addressing at least 1 Researcher, 1 Developer and 1 entrepreneur.__ Teams with more than 1 developer will be positively validated as to build an MVP in 9 months will require a strong
dedication.
        - **Resources:** Demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of the resources assigned to get the objectives/deliverables proposed. One important aspect is that applicants’ state clearly in the proposal that what they propose can be developed using LEDGER partners’ capabilities.
        - **Gender balance:** Gender balance and teams with higher percentage of female team members will obtain more points in the -pre-scoring phase.
    - **Bonus points**
        - LEDGER Open Calls will also reward especially those teams that present high impact solutions __satisfying values such as privacy-by-design; the capacity to influence the norms and standards regulating technological, algorithmic and data sovereignty; business models that provide revenue for all participants, for instance in the form of decentralised dividend allocations and forms of business structures like platform cooperatives that leverage steward-ownership models for the Internet Commons.__
            - Privacy by design, technological normas and standards = Holochain world [[Thomas]]
            - Business models = [[Team of Teams]] and [[Open coop/murmurings.]] / [[Mapping Project]] [[Roberto]] [[Oli]]
- **Review process**
    - An exhaustive “Review Process” will be implemented in order to do a proper follow up of the selected bottom-up projects: there will be several “Review milestone” and the financial support will be provided after some of these milestones, always linked to the achievement of the KPIs/Deliverables established. The “Review Milestones” will be applied in 2 steps as illustrated in the following figure: __(click arrow to unfold diagram)__
    - In a first step of the review process, the Technical/Business performance will be evaluated based on the KPIs and Deliverables established at the beginning of each Stage by the “Mentoring Committee”. Bottomup projects not reaching the minimum KPIs or whose Deliverables are not validated by the “Mentoring Committee” yet, because they are not mature enough, will not be candidates to upgrade to the next stage. These projects will not get the payment associated to the milestone until their mentors and LEDGER project managers consider the milestone achieved. They will be able to continue with the programme and next milestones until the end of the first stage of the venture builder programme (month 9).
    - In the second step, the “Selection Committee’’, will ratify a final decision, based on the info provided by the “Mentoring Committee”. The teams will receive a detailed feedback and advice to further develop their activities from LEDGER Mentors.

            - Description
                - WeQuest is a community-governed digital billboard installed in small towns and city neighbourhoods.  Instead of advertisers, passers-by can publish what they can offer (a local tour, a culinary specialty, english lessons etc) and request anything they need (organic food, a new bench in the park etc.). It represents a digital common, which reconnects locals to a fully-inclusive peer-to-peer economy. The WeQuest companion app enables the citizens to submit a listing for goods or services: the geo-localised needs are aggregated onto an offers/requests map and shared with passers by.
                - Any person will be able to see this information and become providers (or consumers) for the listed needs (or offers), in exchange for money and mutual community credits, computed automatically based on the density and intensity of needs. WeQuest also reserves part of the monetary transactions into a community fund, giving citizens the power to govern and finance the most interesting community projects.

Highlight the innovative approach behind it (e.g. ground -breaking objectives, novel concepts and approaches, new products, services or business and organisational models) (max. 1000 characters)
            - Response
                - Small towns in southern Europe are progressively losing population as people and business migrates towards opportunity in the big cities. Surviving businesses often struggle to make ends meet. WeQuest provides a digital platform that is able to turn this economic death spiral into a positive one. WeQuest first addresses the place-based specific needs and opportunities present in different communities - listening to the local context and gathering local needs and resource information. This is shared openly, enabling full economic participation.
                - WeQuest connects people in a fully-inclusive peer-to-peer economy. By using this alternative blockchain-backed monetary incentive system, we empower people to conduct trustworthy peer-to-peer interactions with each other. This enables people to contribute to the local community despite their current socio-economic situation.

            - Response
                - This project is based on research done at the University of Amsterdam by one of our team members. We have run a multi-agent system simulation of an economy that is based on resources, rewarding actors for directly satisfying the most common needs. The simulation resulted in less inequality and more needs satisfied than the baseline. However, in order to properly function the agents had access to a shared state where global needs information could be read. Thanks to DLT, WeQuest is able to replicate the simulated conditions in the real world.
        - [x] **Technology description **
            - Description

            - Response
                - We base our tech stack on Holochain and Ethereum. Ethereum is the de-facto standard for smart contracts and used to guarantee data integrity during the fulfillment of orders. The agent centric approach provided by Holochain is used to track trust and mutual credit. The hardware requirements we require are large touch totems (commonly used in digital advertisements) as the onboarding signal for local passers by to engage with immediately, or through cross-platform companion applications.

(max 1000 characters)
            - Response
                - Our solution should be deployed where it is most needed and we have already collected interest from 5 small municipalities in Italy devastated by the 2016 earth-quake. We intend to run pilots in these towns and refine the solution starting with real use cases and integrating the feedback. After validating the idea case in small towns, we will spread to larger towns (> 1000 inhabitants) enabling credits to be used across locations. Our longer term goal is the poorest neighbourhoods in big cities, starting with Athens, Rome, Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona and Lisbon.
        - [x] **Business model **

                - Explain to us your business model. How do you plan to commercialise your product and accumulate shared gains for the entire ecosystems impacted by it? (max 500)
            - Response
                - We will offer installation of the integrated system at a fixed cost for the municipalities. The generated revenues will be directly fed into the improvement and development of new features and network expansion.
                - Besides local community funds, our smart contract also saves a part of the transactions into a "network funding pool". Although anyone can apply, as core developers and initiators, we will have the experience and credibility to tap into these extra resources for the improvement and the spread of the platform.
