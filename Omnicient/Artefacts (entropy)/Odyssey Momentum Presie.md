# Odyssey Momentum Presie


- NABC: We need to fill out the NABC for our pitch. What is an NABC? It is clearly formulating the following:
- N: Needs that we are serving with our solution. In this case Needs for users and Needs for stakeholders?
- A: Approach that we choose. Why do we work with holochain? Why persona/profiles (see Josh Questions)
- B: Benefits; What are benefits of our solution for users and for stakeholders?
- C: Competition (I know not or lingua but..) What makes our approach interesting, unique compared to others?
- 
- Deliverables asked by Odyssee and the use of NABC:
- What opportunity do you present? What problem are you solving (NEEDS)in which way (APPROACH),  why is yr solution the way to go (BENEFITS )and what is it's potential (COMPETITION))? 
- Any important part we choose to elaborate on? (tech. legal, ) >> COMPETITION (what makes us special and irresistible)
- Pilot project: >> we do not have that yet, maybe we can elaborate on how we are going to build together with [[Roberto]] and conscious cities?
