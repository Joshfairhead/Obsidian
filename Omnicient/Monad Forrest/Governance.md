            - **Typical format for making up roles and rules**
                - something harmful or frustrating happens
                - people in the group talk about it
                - they grow a shared understanding of the problem
                - people suggest different possible responses
                - we evaluate the possibilities, collectively running a complex simulation (__if we agree to this, what might happen next?__)
                - then finally, we decide on a response
            - **Problem > Deliberation > Agreement**
                - Attention drift 
                - Constitutional accretion 
                    - Enspiral Agreements 
                        - Structural (6)
                            - (Board, Brand, Decisions, Financial, People, Ventures).
                        - Boundary (3)
                            - (Diversity, Harassment & Abuse, Personal Conduct)
                        - Nice idea but (2)
                            - (Catalyst and Stewardship)
                        - if you can’t trust __one__ of the agreements, you can’t really trust __any__ of them
                - Delusional mythology
            - **Can we do better than written agreements?**
                - **Continuous participatory change**

                - Teams of teams
                    - The invitation was “welcome to the community, jump in and contribute, find opportunities, get supported to do meaningful work” and I think it is maturing into “welcome to the community: find a dinner table you like, or start a new one”. The difference is subtle but represents a profound shift in expectations: the network does not provide support, you can only expect support once you’ve found your team.
