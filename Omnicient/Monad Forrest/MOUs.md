# MOUs
- **Business Ethics**
    - **Community Relationship**
The partner shall operate in goodwill to support and foster the long-term sustainable development of local communities, e.g. by fostering co-operation and minimizing the negative impact of its business operations (internalisation of cost)
    - **Agency enabling**
The partner shall exercise best efforts to enable the development of integrated identity practices (Generative Identity + SSI). Users should be in the driving seat and software should be accessible. We work as a free soul collective, agency reducing practices such as NDA's are considered loud red flags. Sometimes necessary if the counter-party has prior signed agreements but we generally consider this a colonial practice. 
    - **Cooperative Behavior**
The partner shall carry out their activities in a fair manner consistent with 
        - (the earth charter)
        - There should be minimal asymmetry in power dynamics, we're building a flatter society to enable greater participation in the act and creation of life itself. 
    - **Safeguarding Personal Data and Right to Privacy**
The partner shall ensure that any activities relating to personal data shall be conducted in accordance with European and applicable national data protection laws (GDPR)
    - **Digital Environment** 
The partner shall strive to maintain and curate a healthy information ecology within the digital commons. They shall endeavour to reduce extractive silo practices and reduce friction around interoperability by following established standards and ontologies whenever possible (rather than reinventing the wheel). 
    - **Labor and Human Rights**
We are working on intersectional socio-technology. Partners should endeavour to prioritise groups growing natural, knowledge, social & technological commons while elevating the marginalised and reducing gaps in empowerment. 
- **Business Pipeline**
    - This MOU is non-binding but expires after 1 year
    - We are happy to engage in exploratory partnerships if the above values seem to be in alignment. Explorations may include:
        - Ethical alignment
        - Proof of concept
        - Viability assesment
        - Technology exploration
        - Capabilities assessment
        - Capacity alignment
    - This would conclude explorations, and if acceptable we would move towards a service level agreement. This should take the form of a technical partnership: 
        - Licensing agreements
            - We primarily work with MIT licensed software. Depending on the situation GPL may also be used if appropriate.
        - Scoping sessions
            - Scope is also to be decided in accordance with the team and through principles of self-organization, the responsible actors will personally sign on the task.
        - Time line agreements
            - We work with continuous delivery and continuous improvement to minimise speculation on future events. 
        - Cost agreements
            - We reserve the right to decide on fee setting per element of work, this will generally be negotiated upfront as an estimate for the sake of transparency. 
        - User testing
