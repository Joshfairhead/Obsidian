# Three Amigos

## Key Players
- Product owner; 
	- As a _Product Owner_, there's always the need to know that things are on track and that the people creating the product are on the same page. At a basic level, this means ensuring that what is being planned, matches business stakeholder expectations.
- Developer;
	- As a _Developer_, it's important to have clarity on the scope of the project to determine how to engineer the code that needs to be written. It's often likely that defining certain details or refining ACs will determine development choices. .
- Tester;
	- For _Testers_, a common problem is to have tasks "thrown over the wall" with the expectation of achieving meaningful testing. Testers always look for context to help define what is to be tested. With this, it becomes significantly easier to have a good idea of how to do the actual testing..
- Designer;
	- For _Designers,_ there's a need to get feedback from the team and to showcase designs. It may be that further designs are required, or some details of implementation need solidifying via quick conversations with Developers, Testers or POs..
