# Capra Course L12

    - Summary
        - Over the last few decades, the research institutes of the global civil society have developed and tested hundreds of systemic solutions to our global problems in all parts of the world (__Section 18.1__). They include proposals to reshape economic globalization and restructure corporations; new forms of ownership that are not extractive but are generative; a wide variety of systemic solutions to the interlinked problems of energy, food, poverty, and climate change; and the large number of systemic design solutions known collectively as ecodesign. In this last lecture of the course, I review some of the most important of these systemic solutions in three areas: energy and climate change, sustainable agriculture, and ecodesign.
        - The illusory pursuit of unlimited economic growth, powered by fossil fuels, has resulted in deforestation, soil erosion, water scarcity, and massive species extinction; and the most dramatic consequences have been the various manifestations of climate change, which threaten the existence of life as we know it on our planet. These considerations make it evident that our energy crisis is a systemic crisis requiring systemic solutions. Before turning to the existing systemic solutions, I contrast them with two non-systemic, or false, solutions — “clean coal“ and nuclear power — which do not solve the problem but merely shift it to other parts of the system (__Section 18.2__).
        - I then review three strategies for developing energy sources that are clean, efficient, abundant, and renewable: "[[Plan B]]" by Lester Brown, "[[Reinventing Fire]]" by [[Amory Lovins]], and "[[The Third Industrial Revolution]]" by [[Jeremy Rifkin]]. Though slightly different in their focus, all three strategies are informed by ecological awareness and systemic thinking, and hence they are mutually supportive and complementary. Together they present compelling evidence that the transition to a fossil-fuel-free future is possible and affordable today with existing technologies (__Sections 18.2.4-6__).
        - Turning to food and agriculture, I contrast the two basic types of food systems we have today. On the one hand, food is produced industrially by a system of agriculture that is highly centralized, energy-intensive, and fossil-fuel-based. On the other hand, we have a variety of agricultural techniques, often based on traditional practices, in which organic food is grown in decentralized, community-oriented, energy-efficient, and sustainable ways. These techniques are variously known as "organic farming," "permaculture," or "sustainable agriculture." In recent years, the term "agroecology" has emerged as a unifying term.
        - I emphasize that industrial agriculture is linked to climate change in two important ways. On the one hand, industrially produced food systems are energy intensive and fossil-fuel based, and hence contribute significantly to global warming. On the other hand, the crops grown in the genetically homogeneous monocultures characteristic of industrial agriculture are not resilient to the climate extremes that are becoming more frequent and more violent.
        - I also point out that the main objective of introducing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into agriculture has been to increase the sales of chemicals. Thus, many of the ecological hazards of GMOs are exactly the same as the hazards of chemical agriculture. (__Sections 18.3.1-2__)
        - Agroecology, on the other hand, is sustainable because it embodies ecological principles that have been tested by evolution for billions of years. Such practices raise agricultural productivity in ways that are economically viable, ecologically sound, and socially uplifting. A key principle of agroecology is the diversification of farming systems through intercropping, agroforestry, and other techniques. Such agricultural biodiversity significantly enhances resilience to extreme climate events. Moreover, when soil is farmed organically, its carbon content increases, which means that CO2 is drawn from the atmosphere. In other words, agroecology not only is more resistant to global warming; it also helps stabilize the climate, whereas industrial agriculture aggravates climate change (__Section 18.3.3__).
        - In the last part of the lecture, I review several examples of ecodesign, an approach to design inspired by nature with principles that reflect the principles of organization ecosystems have evolved to sustain the web of life. I concentrate on two areas of ecodesign: the incorporation of nutrient and waste cycling into industrial design, and green architecture, both in buildings and in urban design (__Section 18.4__).
        - I conclude that the systemic solutions discussed in this last lecture provide compelling evidence that the systems view of life has given us the knowledge and the technologies to build a sustainable future. What we need is political will and leadership. From the systems point of view, leadership means facilitating the emergence of novelty, as I discussed in Lecture 9. This kind of leadership can and should be exercised today by all of us. The Earth is our common home, and creating a sustainable world for our children and for future generations is our common task (__Section 18.5__).

        - In Lecture 12 I present agroecology as an impressive example of a systemic solution. This 17-minute video by Fair World Project documents this example in detail, showing that organic regenerative farming saves energy, improves public health, and is critical to stabilizing the climate.
- Systemic Solutions
    - In the previous lecture we have seen that the major problems of our time are interconnected and interdependent which require corresponding systemic solutions. Solutions which dont solve any problem in an isolated way but deal with it in the context of other related problems, which means that systemic soloutions tend to solve several problems at the same time.
        - Lets take an example from the field of agriculture - if we change from our chemical, large scale industrial system of large scale agriculture to community oriented organic farming - this change would contribute significantly to solving three of our major problems; 
            - 1) it would greatly reduce our energy dependence, because today at least in the US, we use 1/5th of our energy to grow and process our food. 
            - 2) the healthy organically grwon food would have a huge impact on public health such as heart disease, diabetes, strokes and so on are directly linked to our diet.
            - 3) Organic farming would contribute significantly to alleviating climate change because organic soil is a carbon rich soil which means it draws down Co2 from the atmosphere and locks it up in organic substances in this way reduces Co2 content of our atmosphere.
            - This is just one example of a typical systemic solution
        - Over the last few decades the research institutes and centres of learning of the global civil society, mentioned in the previous lecture, have developed hundreds of these systemic solutions in all parts of the world.
        - In this lecture, the last lecture of the course - we'll review some of the most important solutions. In our text book theres about 60 pages dedicated to detailed discussion on effective systemic solutions to our global crisis; these include proposals to reshape economic globalisation and restructure corporations, new forms of ownership that are not extractive but regenerative, a wide variety of systemic solutions to the interlinked issues of energy, food and climate change, and finally the large number of systemic design solutions known collectively as eco design which embody the basic principals  of ecology. Only a few of these new and exciting solutions can be discussed in this lecture so we'll concentrate on three areas; energy and climate change, energy and agriculture, and ecodesign.
    - So lets begin with **Energy**
        - As we know, modern industrial society depends crucially on a continuous supply of abundant energy for our food production and manafacturing, the lighting and heating of our homes and our worldwide network of transportation and communication
        - The very fabric of modern civilisation is sustained by massive flows of energy so that the illusory pursuit perpetual economic growth, discussed in [[Capra course lecture 11]], generates ever increasing demands for energy. And as our  access to cheap and abundant fossil fuels reaches its peak and begins to decline, our economic crisis and our energy crisis become extricably linked.
        - The declining supplies of fossil fuels however is only one of many facets of our twin crisis of energy and economic growth. The persuit of unlimited economic growth powered by fossil fuels has resulted in deforestation, soil erosion, water scarcity and massive species extinction - and the most dramatic consequences has been the various manifestations of climate change which threaten the very existence of life as we know it on our planet.
        - These considerations make it evident that our energy crisis is an systemic crisis requiring systemic solutions. **Several solutions have been proposed by scholars and activists in recent years, but unfortunately the systemic thinking required to appreciate these solutions and implement them is extremely rare amongst our corporate and political leaders**
        - What they tend to do is focus on a single issue, which often just shifts the problem to other parts of the system. For example; producing more energy at the expense of biodiversity, public health or climate stability.
        - Lets just briefly look at two of the **false** solutions before moving on to the systemic solutions:
            - Several years ago the coal industry began to promote the notion of clean coal;   now it's evident that coal the dirtiest and most destructive fossil fuel can never be clean. Indeed clean coal is not a new type of coal, but whats in essence an advertising campaign that refers to several new and unproven techniques of carbon capture and storage - none of them have been developed or have work so far.
            - Far more promising is a growing grassroots campaign calling for a moratorium on coal fire power plants, with the eventual goal of closing every power plant in the world and replacing it with renewable energy sources and energy conservation.
            - In previous decades there was great hope that nuclear power may be the new clean fuel that could replace coal and oil, but it soon became apparent that nuclear technology carries enormous risks and costs and today theres a growing sense that its not a viable solution. I've have carefully studied all the available literature and in the book summarised the basic facts about nuclear energy in terms of seven facts, which I call **seven inconvenient truths** - which are documented by the relevant literature and discussed in some detail, here let me just list the seven facts
                - 1) Production creates significant greenhouse gasses and pollution
                - 2) Uranium supplies in the world are very limited
                - 3) Construction time of pants are prohibitively long
                - 4) Nuclear waste storage remains unsolved
                - 5) Nuclear power and weapons with all their dangers are inextricably linked
                - 6) New generation reactors have the same problems and are decades too late
                - 7) Nuclear power is not viable commercially being unable to survive without massive government subsidies
            - No each of these seven facts in itself is a compelling argument against nuclear power, without even invoking the tremendous health and safety risks.
        - Together they make an overwhelming case for phasing out nuclear energy and replacing it with cheaper, cleaner, faster and safer solutions.
        - If coal, and eventually oil an natural gas and nuclear... need to be phased out to stabilise the environment and solve the energy problem - how can we build energy sources that are clean, efficient, abundant and renewable? 
        - Today there are three strategies for designing such energy systems, each of which is documented in a book which has the title of the strategy; and they are [[Plan B]] by [[Lester Brown]], [[Reinventing Fire]] by [[Amory Lovins]] and [[The Third Industrial Revolution]] by [[Jeremy Rifkin]]. We'll talk about each one in a little bit in some detail, but the answer to the energy problem that they all agree on is that there is not just a single answer and that we need a whole bouquet of possibilities, including redesigning our cities, energy saving and so on and so forth, which is different in different countries and geographic regions - theres no magic bullet or single soloution.
        - Let us introduce [[Lester Brown]][[Plan B]] - or a roadmap to save civilisation as he calls it. It is an alternative to business as usual, which can only lead to disaster and its scope is much wider than energy and climate change but stabilising the climate is a principal component of [[Lester Brown]]s scenario. [[Plan B]] proposes several simultaneous actions, all based on existing technologies and illustrated with sucessful examples from countries around the world where these strategies have been shown to work.
            - Eradicating poverty and stabilising population
            - Stabilising climate
            - Restoring the earths ecosystems
        - Here we should mention that there is a notable absence of population growth in virtually all environmental movements, and its a great credit to [[Lester Brown]] that he starts his [[Plan B]] with the plan of eradicating poverty and stabilising population by putting it right up front.
        - The second strategy and scenario is [[Reinventing Fire]] and evocative title by [[Amory Lovins]] developed by him and his colleges at the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] in Colorado.
        - Some of their proposals cover the same ground as [[Lester Brown]]s, but their basic approach is quite different as their focus in narrower than Browns. In their own words "to create an practical vision of a fossil fuel free future backed up by quantitate analysis and to map a pathway to achieve that future". 
        - Their approach is essentially a design approach, but a new kind of systemic and ecoliterate design that [[Amory Lovins]] calls integrative design. The key strategy is to redesign energy systems in such a way that their efficiency is increased multifold. And if you do it in this integrative systemic way, then you have a knock on effect - once energy is saved in one way that implies other savings and so on - a typical systemic solution and so the result is massive savings of energy and cost, and [[Amory Lovins]] hopes this will become so attractive to business that business will become the driving force of the entire process.
        - The third systemic strategy for going beyond fossil fuels is called [[The Third Industrial Revolution]] which has been developed and promoted by economist and activist [[Jeremy Rifkin]]. Its main elements; renewable energy sources, hydrogen as the principal fuel and energy storage system, electrical plug-in vehicles and smart grids; all elements that are also a part of [[Amory Lovins]][[Reinventing Fire]], but in contrast to [[Amory Lovins]] business centred approach, [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and his team work mainly with governmental agencies, especially in Europe, helping them to develop master plans for the transition to the furture hydrogen economy run by hydrogen power and have been very successful in developing these in several countries
        - At the core of [[Jeremy Rifkin]]s scenario lies the idea to combine renewable energies with internet technologies, and in this way he says we will allow individuals to generate their own green energy at their homes, offices and in their factories and to share it with one another across widely distributed smart electricity grids, just as today people create their own stories and images, and share them across widely distributed social media.
        - Those are the three scenarios, and they're all informed by ecological awareness and systemic thinking - and are therefore mutually supportive and complementary. Together they present in my view a compelling evidence that a transition to a fossil fuel free future is possible and affordable with todays technologies that already exist
    - Now lets turn to **Food and Agriculture**
        - [[Lester Brown]]s analysis of the state of the world in [[Plan B]] clearly shows that virtually all our environmental problems; water scarcity, soil erosion, extreme climate events and so on are threats to our food security.
        - Indeed we are facing a global food crisis, which from a systemic perspective is in many ways is similar to our energy crisis and of course the two are closely interlinked. 
        - Today we have two basic types of food systems; on the one hand food is produced industrially by a system of agriculture that is highly centralised, energy intensive and fossil fuel based.
        - On the other hand we have a variety of agricultural techniques often based on traditional practices that are now emerging around the world, where food is grown in community oriented, energy efficient and sustainable ways.
        - Now industrial agriculture is linked to climate change in two important ways. On the one hand industrially produced food systems are energy intensive and fossil fuel based and contribute significantly to climate change by emmiting greenhouse gasses. 
        - On the other hand, the crops grown in the genetically homogenous monoculture which have become characteristic of industrial agriculture are not resilient to climate extremes that are becoming more frequent and more violent
        - Now just to give a quick reminder of the history of industrial agriculture; it originated in the 1960s when petrochemical companies introduced new methods of intense chemical farming. For the farmers the effect was a spectacular improvement in agricultural production and the new era of chemical farming was hailed as the green revolution.
        - However a few decades later the dark side of chemical agriculture became painfully evident, and today it's well known that the green revolution has neither helped the farmers, the land nor the consumers. 
        - The massive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, changed the whole fabric of agriculture and farming as the agrochemical industry persuaded farmers that they could plant a single very expensive crop and control the weeds and pests with chemicals. 
        - This practice of single crop monoculture, entailed high risks of large areas being destroyed by a single pest and it also seriously affected the health of the soil, the farm workers and the people working in agricultural areas.
        - With this new chemical farming, agriculture became mechanised and energy intensive favouring large corporate farmers with sufficient capital and forcing small traditional family farmers off their land and into cities where they joined the mass of unemployed people. 
        - The ecological imbalance caused by monocultures and excessive use of chemicals, resulted in an enormous increase of pests and crop diseases, which farmers countered by spraying elver larger doses of chemicals and so a vicious cycle was put in motion - a cycle of depletion and destruction.
        - And of course the threats to human health increased accordingly as more and more toxic chemicals seeped through the soil, contaminated the water table and showed up in our food. Now in the 1990's the agrochemical companies attempted to generate a new wave of technological optimism with the application of genetic engineering to agriculture, claiming that the health problems of chemical farming as well as world hunger could all be solved with the help of genetically modified organisms, so called GMOs - in the book theres a long section we dont have time to go into but lets just emphasise the main point that needs to be remembered - **the main objective of GMO in agriculture has been to increase the sale of chemicals - and so that crops that are resistant to a certain chemical and the farmer can spray even more, but of course it goes into the soil and food and so on.**
        - So many of the ecological hazards of GMOs and exactly the same as the hazards of chemical agriculture, which is all bad news but fortunatly there is an viable and sustainable alternative known as **organic farming, permaculture, or sustainable agriculture** and in recent years **Agroecology has increasingly been used as a unifying term** referring both to the scientific basis and the actual practice of an agriculture based on ecological principals.
        - When farmers grow crops organically, they use techniques based on ecological knowledge rather than chemistry and generic engineering. They plant a variety of crops, rotating them so that any insect attracted to one crop will die out or move on with the next cycle. 
        - Instead of chemical fertilisers these farmers enrich their fields with manure and with tilled in organic material from previous crops so that they return organic matter into the soil where it joins the ecological cycle
        - This farming style is sustainable because it embodies ecological principals that have been tested by evolution over billions of years. Organic farmers know that a fertile soil is a living soil, containing literally billions of living organisms in every cubic centimeter - which is just an awesome fact! 
        - It's a complex ecosystem in which the substances that are essential to life move in cycles from plants, to animals, to manure, to soil bacteria and back to plants. Solar energy is the natural fuel which drives these ecological cycles and living organisms of all sizes are necessary to sustain the whole system, both above and below ground.
        - A key principal of agroecology is the diversification of farming systems, mixtures of crop varieties are grown through so called intercropping, that is growing tow or more corps in close proximity, agroforestry which means combining trees and shrubs with crops and so on.
        - Livestock is also integrated into farms to support the ecosystems in the soil and all these practices of moving things around, recycling things, putting the residue of old crops back into the soil - all this is very labour intensive and community oriented, which is good because supports local communities. 
        - In other words, agroecology is able to raise agricultural productivity in ways that are economically viable, ecologically sound and socially uplifting. The literature cited in the book contain some very moving testimonies from farmers who say that not only are they much better off but that their dignity and families have been restored and so on. 
        - **Now of critical importance for the future of agriculture is the observation that resilience to extreme climate events is closely lined to ecological biodiversity** and this is a key characteristic of agroecology.
        - in recent years several surveys conducted after climate disasters have shown that farms using agroecological practices suffered much less damage than their neighbouring farms that didnt and grew crops 'conventionally'
        - **Moreover, when soil is farmed organically its carbon content increases because carbon is the chemical backbone of life; and therefore organic farming contributes to reducing Co2 in the atmosphere because when the carbon levels increase, carbon is drawn down from the atmosphere!**
        - In other words, agroecology is not only more resistant to global warming than industrial agriculture it also helps stabilise the climate... where as industrial agriculture aggravates it.
        - Now also worth noting, and this is not a well know fact and should therefore be disseminated widely, is that carbon sequestration in soil and plants today is the only know and proven technology to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and therefore in the long run to stabilise climate. 
    - Moving on now to the last group of systemic solutions in this lecture, and that is **Ecodesign**
        - The solutions discussed so far all contribute to to the ultimate goal of creating a sustainable future. Hence they are all informed by ecological awareness, they embody various valuable lessons which we can learn from natures ecosystems, the communities of plants, animals and microorganisms which have sustained life for billions of years.  
        - Such an approach to design inspired by nature, is known as ecological design or ecodesign.**From an ecological perspective, design consists of shaping flows and energy of matter for human purposes.** - which is a very broad definition. 
        - **"Ecological design is the careful meshing of our human purposes with the larger patterns and flows of the natural world"** - [[David Orr]] [[Quotes]]
        - And so ecodesign principals reflect the principals of organisation that nature has evolved to sustain the web of life. To practice design in such a context requires a profound change of attitude towards nature, instead of trying to find out what we can extract from nature for our benefit, we have to ask what can we learn from it!
        - As you know over the last decades, there has been a dramatic rise in ecological design processes and practices, all of which are now well documented. 
        - Many of the systemic solutions discussed in this lecture can be seen very broadly ecodesign practices, from the integrative design practices by [[Amory Lovins]] and his colleges, to farming practices that use basic ecological principals. 
        - Now I want to review some examples from two broad areas of ecodesign. One is the incorporation of nutrient and waste recycling into industrial design and the other is the application of ecodesign principals to the built environment, both the buildings and cities. 
        - Now the cyclical nature of ecological processes, sometimes expressed in the compact formulation of **Waste = Food** - which is one of the key principals of ecology
        - For human communities it means that all products produced and manufactured by industry, as well as the wastes produced in the manufacturing processes, must eventually provide nourishment for something new. 
        - So **a sustainable business organisation would be embedded in an ecology of organisations in which the waste of any one organisation would be a resource for the next. The total out flow of each organisation, its products and waste, would be perceived and treated as resources cycling through the system. **
        - Such ecological clusters of industries have actually been initiated in many parts of the world by [[Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives (ZERI)]] and was founded by a business entrepreneur called [[Gunter Pauli]]
        - Heres an ecological cluster around a columbian coffee farm in which the remains of a coffee plant (which are massive) are used to grow shitake mushrooms (a delecacy) which feed earthworms, cattle and pigs which feed chickens, cattle and pig manure are used to produce bio gas and so on - its all cycled and used for other processes
            - ![](assets/1626444309_38.png)
        - In such a system zero emissions means zero waste, and ultimately implies zero material consumption. Like natures ecosystems, a sustainable human community would use energy that flows from the sun but would not consume any material goods without recycling them after use. Moreover, zero emissions means zero pollution, ZERI's ecological clusters are designed to operate in an environment free of toxic waste and of pollution. 
        - So you see this very basic ecodesign principal and principal of ecology of **waste = food** points to the ultimate soloution of may of our enviromental problems,
        - Most of the ZERI clusters involve organic resources and waste, but of course the ecodesign principal of waste = food, needs to be applied to industrial systems. This concept has been best articulated by [[EcoDesigners]] [[Michael Braungart]] in Germany, and [[William McDonough]] in the US.
        - [[Michael Braungart]] and [[William McDonough]] speak of two kinds of metabolisim, the biological metabolism and what they call the technical metabolism. 
        - Matter that cycles in the biological metabolisim is biodegradable and becomes food for other living organisms, literally as in the coffee plant ecological cluster.
        - Now materials that are not biodegradable are regarded as technical nutrients, which continually circulate in industrial cycles separate from the organic cycles and they cycle between manufacturers and consumers, which if fully implemented would lead to a fundamental restructuring of economic relationships. **After all if you think about it, what we want from a technical product is not a sense of ownership - we want the service it provides**, we want entertainment from our DVD players, we want mobility from our cars, cold drinks from our refrigerator... **so from the perspective of ecological design it makes no sense to own these products, and makes much more sense to buy their services - that is to lease or rent them. **
        - Ownership would stay with the manufacturer, who would take the products back after their useful lifetime or when you want to upgrade and have a better DVD player and give the old one back. They would then know that they would have to recycle all the components which would dramatically change the design process, because if I would have to recycle my products - I'd better design them in a way that they can be easily taken apart and recycled. 
        - **This idea of the technical nutrients and cycles would create an economy that is no longer based on the ownership of good but on service and flow, much closer to the flow processes we observe in ecosystems**
    - Finally, lets move to **green archetecture**, an areas where eco design has led to a wid range of impressive innovations
        - We now have buildings that are designed to produce more energy than they consume, that emit no waste, monitor their own perfomance and so on. 
        - Similar considerations are applied to urban design. The urban and suburban sprawl, which characterises most modern cities has created very high automobile dependance with a minimal role for public transport, cycling or walking. 
        - The consequences are high consumption of gasoline, correspondingly high levels of smog and of course severe stress in traffic jams and congestion of our cities, let alone loss of street life, communities and public safety
        - The last three decades have seen the movement of an international ecocity movement which tries to counteract urban sprawl by using ecodesign principals to redesign our cities so they become ecologically healthy. 
        - This was in part originated in Barazil with the city of Curichiba that became a model for many other cities around the world as there are about 60 cities around the world which have adopted the Curichiba model. 
        - Many cities have old historic city centres with high density and mixed land use which have been reconverted into the car free environment which they originally were in the middle ages or the Renaissance. Other cities have been created modern car free environments by encouraging walking and cycling, redesigning neighbourhoods to turn them into urban villages which display high density structures combined with green spaces. 
        - The application of ecodesign principals has brought these areas multiple benefits; significant savings, and a healthy safe and community friendly environment - with drastically reduced levels of pollution. And also greatly reduced levels of crime by the way, because they are closely knit communities. 
        - Coming to the conclusion of the lecture and whole course I want to emphasise that the systemic solutions discussed in this lecture provide compelling evidence that the systems view of life has given us the knowledge and technologies to build a sustainable future.
        - **What we need is political will and leadership** - and from the systems view you may remember that I discussed this  - leadership means facilitation the emergence of novelty, and this kind of leadership can and should be exercised by all of us to overcome our global crisis.
        - Now I'm often asked "is there enough time to save human civilisation, can we have hope for the future?" and of course these are very important existential question. For me personally, the most inspiring answer to this important existential question comes from the great Czech playwright and statesman [[Vaclav Havel]]
        - [[Vaclav Havel]] turns the question into a meditation on hope itself; heres what Havel wrote when he was imprisoned as a dissident under the soviet regime - the kind of hope that I often think about and understand above all as a state of mind and not about the state of the world 
            - "Either we have hope within us or we don't, it is a dimension of the soul and is not essentially dependent on a particular observation of the world or estimate of the situation. Hope is not the conviction that a situation will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it will turn out" [[Quotes]] [[Vaclav Havel]]
        - Now I hope you will be inspired by [[Vaclav Havel]] as much as I have been and will continue to help build a world that is sustainable, peaceful and just. 
        - And with that I thank you for all your attention and contributions to the course.
