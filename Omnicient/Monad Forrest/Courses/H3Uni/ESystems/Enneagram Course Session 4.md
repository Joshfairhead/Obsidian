    - A question was asked about the difficult times we are going through and could the enneagram shed light on this. My response was that although there must be possibilities for that I did not know of a specific study. Mainly it is a vehicle to help us with the transition in relation to pour specific lived projects.
    - What is needed is a better understanding of Epochs and the Greater Present Moment. I gave a one day seminar on this in the Dundee Discovery Centre (adjoining the original exploration ship __Discovery__) with the International Futures Forum (IFF) some dozen years ago. Those interested might find the videos a useful perspective. Here are the links:
        - Introduction      https://vimeo.com/67200505    3.38m
        - Part 1                 https://vimeo.com/67203847     35m
        - Part 2                 https://vimeo.com/67399868     45m
        - Part 3                 https://vimeo.com/67447830     21m
        - Part 4                 https://vimeo.com/67457043      24m
    - Part 1 is particularly relevant for setting the scene.
    - I would revise write a lot of the topical background to update e.g. the impact of the Pandemic and growth of populism but the guts of it is more relevant than ever!
    - I've enjoyed meeting you on this course. I hope you will find the E-System with its enneagram guidance model will help you in your various destinies.
