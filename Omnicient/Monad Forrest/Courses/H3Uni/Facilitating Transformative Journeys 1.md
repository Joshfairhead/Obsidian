- Excersise 1
    - You will be (as far as possible) be divided into trios. In your trio you have 10m for the exercise and then we will have 5m for sharing some observations.

    - Agree an allocation of roles:	
        - Existential perspective – the challenge of climate change
        - Methodological perspective – how we need to respond to it
        - Personal perspective – what it will demand of us
    - Each in turn has 1m to state how you see the situation from your perspective; others listen. Three rounds.
    - Spend the remaining minutes in conversation around what has come up. 
    - Angles you might share are:

        - how do the three perspectives differ?
        - how to they converge?
        - what might be transformational?
    - You will have 1m warning before returning to the plenary session
