### Note on Scale
2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7
Essence / Character / Action / Significance / Coalescence / Generative power

### Example methodology
We take the term "Riding a Bike" as our monadic field of interest. 
Bike is the subject matter or content. Riding it is the context.
Zoom in on the subject matter "Bike" and create a dyad.

| Essence | Existance |
|---|---|
| Frame | (not-frame) |
| Frame | Accessories |

We can now zoom in on the accessories, the existance side to learn more about the subject of "bike". Note that the existance side allows for further articulation as its of an objective nature, the subjective side is harder and often more implicit. 

Triplicating the accessories we get: 

| 3 | 6 | 9 |
|---|---|---|
| Pedals | Breaks | Wheels |

- Pedals are the active force
- Breaks are the denying force
- Wheels are the reconciling force

The six laws of three should be constructed at this point. I'm being lazy though. This statement acknowleges a technical debt that may bite my ass

Now we get to the field of action. The fundementals of the subject "bike" have been articulated, but the attributive context of the verb "riding" has not. 

| Directive Agency | Ground | Ideal | Instrumental means |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rider | Inertia | Momentum | Arms/Legs |
