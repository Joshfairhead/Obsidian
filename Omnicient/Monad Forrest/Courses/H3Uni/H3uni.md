### Slack ramblings to share my insights
> A couple of experiences to share;On a sleepless evening the other night I found myself figuring out games to play in my head with QualSystems. I just lay there thinking about triads and decided to build them out of monads. For whatever reason I chose 'hope' and started to construct a triad that formed into 'desire' (3), 'possibility'(6) and 'agent' (9). Put in words; ones desires of the future within a possibility space. At this point I considered it 'close enough' for a late evening and the mental tax but I was still sleepless so decided to do another. Being tiered I decided to just pick a fresh monad from the previously constructed triad and realized that while doing so continuously was probably not particularly useful, doing so may prove a good whetstone to sharpen ones mental saw with. An excersise or game to play for the sake of practice.

> After jumping through a few rounds, monkey mind was still clattering around and an association came to me about the process of practice. For certain it seems that a legitimate use of these systems is linear; monad, dyad, triad etc. but what about their non-linear uses? In enneagram waters it seems that monad into triad is a generally accepted move. What about monads into tetrads into dyads into heptads into dyads? Are there principals governing those relationships? Such qualitative discontinuities felt quite analogous to music... What are the primary "intervals" then? I guess its one step up a system like we practiced in the workshops (inductive). The next coherent move feels like its probably moving one step down a system. With the ability to move in both directions the next step would be jumps of two steps up or down. If practiced methodically, this should eventually allow one to move coherently from any system to any system - an approach I wish I'd taken when first learning the guitar!

[Axiom I](http://web.archive.org/web/20191021205333/http://www.magic-flight.com/pub/uvsm_1/axiom_1.htm).

> In the first link Landry essentially asserts that Relation is primary to all things as an axiom of Truth. If such an axiom holds (and it seems like an elegant proof to me) then it frames QualSystems as a tool of perception; truly seeing reality through an understanding of the relationships that constitute existence... and perhaps a solution to the Ontology problem?

> Hey [@Anthony H](https://h3uni.slack.com/team/U01SJSZB2V6), I've just started a short primer on logic from Prof. Jevons (1902) and am finding a lot of triads and even potential Enneagram style structures.What I've seen so far in the deductive reasoning (I'll move past it soon):  
3: Propositions  
6: Terms  
9: Syllogisms

> While not explicitly stated, the syllogism section also potentially seems embed the six laws of three. The example given is the following conjunction of three propositions, which uses each term twice:
> 3: All *mushrooms* are **good to eat**  
> 6: This fungus is a *mushroom*  
> 9: Therefore this fungus is **good to eat**I'm not entirely sure that my hunch is correct but I thought I'd share.
> 
> The section on terms also has a triadic quality to it:  
3: Singular terms  
6: General terms  
9: Collective terms
>
> Again I'm uncertain of my arrangement in this section. I chose singular terms as 3 because I'm thinking about Landrys triad; the immanent has a present tense quality to it reflecting activeness. I chose general terms as 6 because it has an omnicient or passive feel to it; its the name of many things but any one of those things separate from the others. I chose collective terms as 9 because it feels trancendental or reconciling in nature; it is a whole that reconciles wholes (eg europe is a collective term for a set of countries that are in themselves whole). If anyone wishes to engage, I wonder how this reasoning sounds to others?

> The section on positive/negative terms also feels quite relevant in regards to the "excluded middle". For example Jevons says that the negative of hot is not cold because they are both in reference to something. Hot possessing more than a particular baseline, cold possessing less; thus hot is not the presence of heat, nor cold the absence. The negative of hot thus being something like "not-hot" or "unhot" etc. Pure positives/negatives are distinct opposites (contiguous I believe is the appropriate term).

> Ok, so that's scavenging for triads rather than constructing them myself. But since I've mentioned the term Contiguity above I thought I'd relate a construction NOT scavenged, and therefore potentially much flakier... I built one from my inquiry into "forms of relationships" (yes, still reductive/singular terms - I acknowledge this):  
3: Correspondence  
6: Contiguity  
9: Copresence

> This could be waaay off because at least two of the terms were based on synonym searches and etymology searches. None the less it feels to me as if its about right, but maybe a fuzzy resolution. 3 seems of an immanent or active modality; its a dynamism. 6 seems of an Omnicient or passive/receptive modality; its discontinuous, viewing the relationship from above and at a distance - there's adjacency present but the observed has distinciton. 9 seems quite transcendental/reconciling in its nature; all is one through a state of existence (possibly an imprecise descriptor, presence would be a better word/property but its in the term already so duh) - which reconciles.
> 
> Feedback is welcome, especially if off course. Not sure what else to share other than an Obsidian vault of scavenged sets I've found about the place; celtic triads and such. Oh yes, I have a question on the step between two and three. Two is polarity right? Contiguity perhaps, or a distinct separation of terms. It feels to me that the gear shift from two to three requires pure opposites (e.g. subjective/objective) to work, sudo-diads (like hot/cold) resulting in confusion - is such an intuition on the right lines?

> Thinking about '"life" in the biological context as provoked by some of the reading Ales shared:  
3: Autopoietic unit  
6: Cognition  
9: Enviornment
> 
> Putting an emphasis on the Immanent/Active force (3), we can zoom in on the autopoietic unit:  
> 3: Alive  
> 6: Vital  
> 9: Creative
>
> This led zooming in on Alive (3), mixed up with some lyrics from Maynard James Keenan, with a little twist of my own:  "I am therefore I do, I do therefore I become, I become, therefore I am"  
> 3: I do  
> 6: I become  
> 9: I am  
>
> Then working with Landrys work on "Real":  
> _All that is without choice, change, and consequence is illusion._  
> _Only that which is at once choice, change, and causality is_ **_real_**_._
>
>3: Change  
6: Choice  
9: Consequence
>
> I started thinking about "Change" (3) and reconciled it against "Alive" (3), and "I do" (3).By comparing these three triads it seems to me that the rate of **change** (**doing**) between **becoming** and **being** (perhaps being and will?), signifies aliveness. Right, this is kind of self evident in the above triads. 
>
>This led to a question; if the rate of **change** signifies **aliveness**, then what is the MOST alive thing there is?Trying to answer this inquiry led me to speculative cosmology, as clearly (to me at least) the quantum boundary that reconciles space/time allowing everything in the universe to flow is the fastest rate of change! A new word then came to me from the noosphere: `Astropoiesis`... (but I think in the Ennegram course this might have been referred to as `Aionios` or `Henosos`, probably the former as one might call this the implicate order?).
