The Stalker (Movie).

Evoking a common mood;
- Being in a starlit night
- Looking through a microscope
- On a landscape with unstable energy
	- Awe, curiosity, energy

## The 12 levels of the universe
Recovering the being of the universe
Our appreciation of the scale and complexity has grown over the last 100 years.


Function = Process 
Being = Holons
Will = Laws

- Where does the human sit amongst the very large and the very small
- What evokes wonder in the human mind
How do all these scale and process

Being: The aspect which gives us a sense of authentic wholes. Jacobs ladder. 
Will: Cosmic laws operating at different levels and providing different results

New postulate: the discontinuity of beingness
- the equivelent of the quatum scale leaps
- Each level playos a different qualitive role
- a cosmos is an interacting combination 

Needed other dimensions of thought and feeling
