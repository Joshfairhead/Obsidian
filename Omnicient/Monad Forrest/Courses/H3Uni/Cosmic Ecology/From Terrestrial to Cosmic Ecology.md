# From Terrestrial to Cosmic Ecology

- Proposing that we need to be more aware of the "forbidden zone" based on belief; be it scientific, religious or cultural belief. 
- Opening up permission for exploration.
	- (in opposition to Neti neti??)
- Wery difficult to do this in a way that is not based on a conditioned belif
- system
- Neti neti, from the vedas; not this not this.
	- How does via negativa relate with opening up permission? Agnostism
- Sketchy outline about how the program will unfold.

## Cosmic Ecology
- Not a science or religion, sort of philosophy but not of philosophers. 
- A playground or field of study
- Often traditions have constraining assumptions.
- Dominant cultures where you'd be excommunicated or executed.
- Some systems have forrayed into this transdiciplinary are; complexity ecuminical 
- There is a widespread social distortion which create a wilful pathology in our world views which block us from discovering a cosmic ecology.
	- This creates a forbidden zone or boundaries:
		- Matter is dumb
		- Only brain is intelligent
		- Human brains are the most intelligent
		- Earth biosphere are not brain and therefore dumb
		- All stuff out there is not brain and therefore dumb
		- Humans are the only not-dumb in the universe

- Permitted exploration/ the cosmic portal
	- Matter is intelligent; intelligence is matter
	- Intelligence/consciousness is prior to the brain
	- Human intelligence is currently cosmically primitive
	- Earth and its biosphere are cosmically intelligent
	- All visible stuff out there is a light manifustation of the hidden intelligence that is actually out there
		- 60% of stuff out there is unknown (dark matter etc)
	- Humans potentially have a role to be cosmically intelligent

What is the contempory context of the forbidden zone?
- "The greater anthropocene"
- the anthropocene is a term shifting from the holoscene, referring to humanities impact on the planet meeting in proportion
- The greater antropocene is used to express the wider context of belief systems
- We seemingly only learn the hard way. 
	- Infintie flat earth; expansive domination and exploitation.
	- Discovering terresterial ecology; Habitat and species extinction
	- Hitting planetary limits; survival of humanity
	- Recognising spiritual failure; survival of the biosphere
	- Discovering cosmic ecology; deeper meaning and purpose
