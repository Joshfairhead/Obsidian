# From Terrestrial to Cosmic Ecology

- Proposing that we need to be more aware of the "forbidden zone" based on belief; be it scientific, religious or cultural belief. 
- Opening up permission for exploration.
	- (in opposition to Neti neti??)
- Wery difficult to do this in a way that is not based on a conditioned belif
- system
- Neti neti, from the vedas; not this not this.
	- How does via negativa relate with opening up permission? Agnostism
- Sketchy outline about how the program will unfold.

## Cosmic Ecology
- Not a science or religion, sort of philosophy but not of philosophers. 
- A playground or field of study
- Often traditions have constraining assumptions.
- Dominant cultures where you'd be excommunicated or executed.
- Some systems have forrayed into this transdiciplinary are; complexity ecuminical 
- There is a widespread social distortion which create a wilful pathology in our world views which block us from discovering a cosmic ecology.
	- This creates a forbidden zone or boundaries:
		- Matter is dumb
		- Only brain is intelligent
		- Human brains are the most intelligent
		- Earth biosphere are not brain and therefore dumb
		- All stuff out there is not brain and therefore dumb
		- Humans are the only not-dumb in the universe

- Permitted exploration/ the cosmic portal
	- Matter is intelligent; intelligence is matter
	- Intelligence/consciousness is prior to the brain
	- Human intelligence is currently cosmically primitive
	- Earth and its biosphere are cosmically intelligent
	- All visible stuff out there is a light manifustation of the hidden intelligence that is actually out there
		- 60% of stuff out there is unknown (dark matter etc)
	- Humans potentially have a role to be cosmically intelligent

What is the contempory context of the forbidden zone?
- "The greater anthropocene"
- the anthropocene is a term shifting from the holoscene, referring to humanities impact on the planet meeting in proportion
- The greater antropocene is used to express the wider context of belief systems
- Waking up the hard way:
	- Infintie flat earth; expansive domination and exploitation.
	- Discovering terresterial ecology; Habitat and species extinction
		- Tragedy of the commons
	- Hitting planetary limits; survival of humanity
		- Tragedy of the horzons
	- Recognising spiritual failure; survival of the biosphere
		- Tragedy of consciousness
	- Discovering cosmic ecology; deeper meaning and purpose (outer and inner)

Acknowledging the greater anthropocene
- arrival of the anthropocene
- Created a planet-wide impasse
- "We are off the map"
- Impact is predominantly negative; why?
	- fragmented incoumplete understanding
		- Distortion
		- Factional exploitation (our truth is the truth)
		- Fantasy (Holly wood alternative)
		- Fixated beliefs
			- Trynig to change belief with better information doesnt work (Daniel Khanamman)
		- Ignorance

Accumulating feedback from the whole 
- for thousands of years we have lived in weakly connected domains and our fragmentation catrophies have not destroyed the Gaian system
- but now oll our domains are strongly connected and catastrophies are no longer in isolation
- our minds remain fragmented with no effective collective basis for evekning humanl planetary situation
- Three tragedies above
	
Ontering the portal we can entertain alternative worldviews and see what new questions loraing and meaning they bring.

Do you agree that world view is an important factor in the social global pathology of humans?

The eternal triangle:
- Convention of finding our place in the cosmos is typically hierarchial
- Cosmos, planet, humanity... in a triangle rather than linear.
	- Links cosmos and humanity on the third side
	- Humanity < Terristeral ecology > Planet
	- Planet  < Cosmo genesis > Cosmos
	- Cosmos < Cosmic ecology > Humanity
		- heuristic.
- Can all be framed as ignorance or wisdom. 
- Big bang does not necessarily explain everything. If its a deter
