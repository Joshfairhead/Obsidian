## The Cosmos in Humanity


Notes
The table of human capacities that you've already seen tells us nothing about the interrelationship between the different components of the organic human. This diagram will illustrate a view of the human system from an experiential point of view. It may start off looking abstract but by a series of exercises with self observation it will assume a practical meaning and value.

We know that part of our human intelligences curiosity so beginning from the term enquiring intent we can bring up from our memory, or more significantly are stored schema, items of information that address our enquiry. This evokes that a more sensitive level some kind of mental image (mental image refers to pattern which may or may not include an actual visual image) and this applies some degree of meaning to our enquiry. This loop is quite typical of our belief systems which we are so easily locked into.

If we are able to do this then instead of addressing the question to our subconscious in search of an answer we can address it to our superconscious or creative level. This is rather like planting a seed in the soil. We know if we put it there under good conditions something will sprout but we cannot see the nature or detail of the soil.
