Notes
The table of human capacities that you've already seen tells us nothing about the interrelationship between the different components of the organic human. This diagram will illustrate a view of the human system from an experiential point of view. It may start off looking abstract but by a series of exercises with self observation it will assume a practical meaning and value.

We know that part of our human intelligences curiosity so beginning from the term enquiring intent we can bring up from our memory, or more significantly are stored schema, items of information that address our enquiry. This evokes that a more sensitive level some kind of mental image (mental image refers to pattern which may or may not include an actual visual image) and this applies some degree of meaning to our enquiry. This loop is quite typical of our belief systems which we are so easily locked into.

If we are able to do this then instead of addressing the question to our subconscious in search of an answer we can address it to our superconscious or creative level. This is rather like planting a seed in the soil. We know if we put it there under good conditions something will sprout but we cannot see the nature or detail of the soil.

Whereas placing a question with consciousness may be reasonably under our control, the creative superconscious is not. Usually in creative work there is an incubation period in which something is cooking behind the scenes but we are not the chef.

Our experience of this level is very much associated with spontaneity of emergent insight. Something just comes out of the blue; we talk of the â€˜flash of genius

But having such a flash does not mean that we have created anything stable. There is the task of embedding that insight into our operating mind which means that we need the capacity for fresh mental images for fresh insights. This may also involved the creation of new language, new symbolism and perhaps new mathematics. The sensitivity level needs to be exercised to be malleable. We can call this having an open mind. It is basic for transdisciplinary thinking.

When the creative insight configures a new pattern or mental image it can then feed back into our enquiring consciousness where we can make some kind of judgement as to its validity relevance and meaning. This becomes the creative cycle represented by the dotted arrows.

In H3Uni we call this high level process repatterning. Creative collaboration requires participative repatterning in which each individual in a group can experience their own process but also express what is coming out in a manner that can be shared and work worked on together.
