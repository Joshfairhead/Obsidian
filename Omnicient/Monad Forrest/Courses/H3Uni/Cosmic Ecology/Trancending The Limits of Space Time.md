Location - there is somewhere
Seperation - there is somewhere else
Rotation -  there are multiple perspectives on somewhere and somewhere else
Succession/Duration - one thing happens followed by another
Potential - of many possible things not all happen
Manifestation - there are relative strengths of happening
Connectivity - Things seem linked to eachother in hidden patterns 

We integrate space and time by motion. 
We realise potential through choice.
Normally we sleepswalk through our dimensional world unless we recive some kind of shock (which can be negative or positive). 
In timeless moments we intuit Undivided Wholeness.
