# The Qualities of Energy at Each Level

Reality ain't what it usud to be
What is energy anyway?
What are we talking about with energy fields?

Reality is just a thin sliver.
We see but a tiny slice of whats out there, shutting out the rest of the universe.

What is energy?
- The capacity to do work
- Any given energy can be defined by its quality (where it sits in the cosmic hierarchy), its quantity (the presence and availability of that energy), and its intensity (the degree to which it is focused to create special conditions)
- We attribute the qualitative role of the different energies as the active side of universal substance which has its own mass energy equivelance at each level.
- It also has its own inherent intelligence to generate its particular range of effects or manifestations at that level.
- Slime mould has some amazing properties; brought up on american oats put in oats from the UK escapes and seeks out the american oats. It solves problems; food outside a maze. Took a map of tokyo rail system and setup a map where each station was represented by oatmeal, took a blob in tokyo center in the map and it explored the area, lached onto the oats, connected them with nutrient webs that matched the map. The blob has no nervous system. When it runs out of food it shuts down and turns into powder until its rehydrated up to two years later. 

Kinetic and potential energy; raising energy level is work, potential at high energy, work as energy release as a force in a direction

Experiencing energy fields
- Gravity 
- Electricity
- Chi

#### The universe as a nexus of energies of different qualities at different levels

Postulate of discontinuity of beingness
- the equivanent of the qualtum leaps at the universal level
- each level plays a different role in the cosmic ecolofy 
- a cosmos is an interacting combination of levels
- so we need the levels to be able to concieve of the cosmoses

Outer stars of the galaxies don't slow down, unlike the planets at the edge.
