# Pattern Thinking with Qualitative Systems

Bennet on Structure / general laws. e.g. seeing the structures within the symbol

- We understand by a mental act that is synthetic and creative; wheras we know by an act that is analytic and outomatic. 
- These mental acts must be projected into the mind and the mind must be able to experience them sensitively as images and consciously as judgements
- some degree of understanding must always be present for effectual action in the world.

### A different basis is needed.
- Knowlege is Omnicient, understanding is Immanent.

### The Pythagorean View
- First principles
- Numbers
- Symmetries
- Harmonies
- Geometricals
^^ leads to the appreciation of the world soul

The lens of knowlege dissassociates subject and object. Understanding not.

### Axiom of Relationship
- The relations by which terms are related are an integral part of the terms they relate.
 OR you cant have a relationship if the relationship cant have you.
 
 ### Participative repatterning
 Pattern = structure
 
 Looking at patterning as isolated objects misses the point. The pattern that connects and the matrix that embeds. 
 - A pattern has an integrity independent of the medium by virtue of which you have recieved the information that it exists. [[Quotes]] (Bucky)

### Qualitative systems 
- As discrete qualities of mutual relevance between self and universe that give rise to understanding. 
- As contrasted with: a split between self and universe with minimal mutual relevance providing knowledge without true understanding

Quantum derives from the discrete enengy levels at the atomic level that can be characterised by numbers as in the theory of atomic structure and electron orbitals. The shift from one state to the other emits or absorbs energy. 

## Pentad
Good for articulating the universal structure of energy. 
Field of action > Significance
What are the interactions that give it the capacity to sustain that significance. 
Alchemy Quintessence (quint = 5). Operating in the service of something higher and served by something lower. 
Higher and lower potentiality that it cant go above or below (or it stops being itself)
Robert Fludd embraced this structure.
