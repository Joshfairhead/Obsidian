        - üìù Write some reflections in your own journal about your experience today
            - Anchors are important, people holding space and keeping an eye on the big picture. Dyadic/triadic chat spaces are also really nice. Crews are necessary for people to feel at home in a congregation but congregations are necissisary to hold crews when they dissipate
            - Others
                - From Marek Koys to Everyone: (07:24 pm)
                    - Clarifying intention of a crew or pod is essential, it should be a regularly activity. ‚Ä®How badly do we want to address this challenge, or work on this theme, together ?‚Ä®All the practical questions will flow from clarity of intention - not the opposite way around. 
                - From Gloria, Dorset UK to Everyone: (07:25 pm)
                    - Mostly just feeling more energised and confident about sending that invite ouot for our community gathering. Setting the practices that nurture and hold the people together feels key. Observing rhythms and holding practices.
                - From [[Kay Gertler]] Exeter to Everyone: (07:26 pm)
                    - developing relational safety, care, trust and honesty in crews seems vital
                - From Ronen to Everyone: (07:26 pm)
                    - I feel a coflict about congregation: when I imagine being in one my heart feels open, when I think about getting there I feel heaviness and confusion.
