        - Case notes
            - 41 min count down
                - Two crews in tech
                    - Blockchain/dev 5ppl active
                    - Marketing/coordination/gov 4 ppl active
                - Should we merge them or not
                - Some dont want to merge them as see them as independent
                - Max and Johann working across both in the [[Liminal]] space
                - Creates time/commitment challanges
                - Though about merging the crews
                - Crew 1/2 funding issues
                - Crew 1 dont like the risk and want to see market validation
                - Crew 2 known as coordination crew cant work for crew 1 as theres a bit of social funding support but would have to let go of the vision to work for team 1
                - Whats this gap? Is it knowledge or interest gaps etc
                - Better to focus on one crew personally?
                - Should it be two crews as congregation or community
            - Step two 
                - Mariana
                    - Should we connect the crews?
                    - Power imbalance with crew 1 
                        - This feels somewhat accurate from the natural hierarchy perspective with crew one more experienced. 
                        - Relying on crew 1 expertise
                - Hugi
                    - Where is the desire coming from 
                    - Heard unclarity about who wants to merge and not
                    - There was discussion around the merging, and an inherent tension
                    - Was that one group or the other or is it the group in total
                        - Max - ppl in both crews are interested in merging, sharing the same purpose and values as people. Synnergy but cant find the middle/catalyst to start a project together long term but its not growing. Whos the power behind
    - üìù Write some reflections in your own journal about your experience today
        - Interesting structure, the with holding of opinion and asking questions was a good shout
