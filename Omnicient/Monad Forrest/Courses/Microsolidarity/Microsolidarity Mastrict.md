    - Summary:  We are a 'Congregation' of about 25 people. We want to gather twice a year, starting in June.  Goal is to support each-other in doing emotionally and financially fulfilling work. 'Crews' are small groups of 3-6 formed between each Gathering. Crews meet around particular goals and intentions. We will start crewing in June.
