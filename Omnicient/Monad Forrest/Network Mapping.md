# Network Mapping

- **Metrics**
    - **Degree** counts the number of connections attached to each element. Useful for identifying hubs in your network or for predicting single points of failure.
    - **Betweenness** tells you how many times a given element is the bridge (or bottleneck) between other elements in the network.
    - **Closeness** tells you how close one element is to all other elements in the network. Useful for identifying which elements can quickly spread good (or bad) information or effects.
