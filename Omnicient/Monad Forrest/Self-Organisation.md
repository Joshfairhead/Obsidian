#### Life
**Membranes**
![](assets/1626444220_5.jpg)
- Constant flow of resources and energy across the membrane to sustain itself 
- In multiplicity these create higher order structures
	- Cell into organs
		- Organs into organisims 
			- [[Organisms]] into ecosystems

**Autopoiesis**
- Open and closed systems that maintain themselves in a state of balancing flow in a far from equilibrium state

**Emergence**
- As positive feedback loops build we reach a threshold where the organism either breaks down or breaks through. Old structures fall away and new ones appear.
#### **Ecosystems**
**Pioneer Ecosystems**
- Quantitate growth; rapidly expands to fill territory
- Qualitative growth; slows down and matures
	- Iteration and refinement on whats already come before
#### **Humans**
**Social membranes**
- Telegram groups
- Discord channels
- Companies
- Solidarity groups

**Memetics**
- Constructivism and [[Stories]] instead genetics
	- Structure and network

#### Learning Organisations
- [Peter Senge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge)
	> 'learning organizations' are those organizations where people continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, and where people are continually learning to see the whole together." - Peter Senge [[Quotes]]
