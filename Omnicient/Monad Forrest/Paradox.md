### [An Argument for Paradoxical Existence](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/fqa0ja/an_argument_for_paradoxical_existence/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
While there have been many attempts at creating and presenting Unified Field Theories or forms of metaphysics that adequately inform some discernible, universal ethic, none have taken hold in any significant or notable manner. I believe this endeavor to be the central problem that Philosophy as a discipline seeks to resolve, and I believe any attempt to resolve it must include and reconcile the concepts of paradox and possibility. This argument represents an attempt to justify the development of a vocabulary, logic, metaphysics, and ethic of paradox to describe reality with greater accuracy by proving existence itself is paradoxical. The philosophical thesis I am trying to defend being: Everything that exists is paradoxical in essence and nature.

The development of this argument and others based upon it will come to form a paradoxical worldview and existential mentality that will inevitably conflict with existing worldviews and mentalities by its mere existence among them. Some contemporary worldviews and mentalities that would be most contrasted, if not directly opposed by this to-be-developed paradoxical perspective include: all religions (more precisely, any that rely upon embodied or anthropomorphized God(s)), neoliberalism, [[Capitalism]], fascism, classical mechanics, and the movement of political correctness, just to name a few. All of these systems, worldviews, and mentalities are riddled with plenty of contradictions and exceptions that would easily deem them incoherent if they were written out or argued formally. Furthermore, many of the existing articles texts that describe those perspectives have indeed already been attacked, derided, or necessarily rejected for the incoherency I just described. A paradoxical worldview as the thesis proposes, if argued and articulated coherently as I seek to do, would therefore be more correctly aligned with reality and thus __preferable,__ if not more desirable (personally and institutionally), than those others due to the reasons outlined above.

Historically, paradoxes and other such contradictions have been seen as signalers that highlight flaws in arguments and used as justification to reject arguments in which paradoxes reside. This is because of the Principle of Explosion, which describes the 'explosive' nature of arguments that intentionally or unintentionally incorporate paradox, as those arguments could be extrapolated to justify anything and everything resulting in perceived triviality or meaninglessness of all components. I suspect this will be the strongest objection to the argument beneath as a whole. I have two responses for this: 1. I have tried to make this argument as simple and coherent as possible to avoid that explosive behavior, a task at which I think I have succeeded. 2. The explosive behavior and subsequent triviality encapsulated by the Principle of Explosion __would not occur__ if existence is **not** paradoxical or meaningless, as the argument below seeks to prove is not the case. In other words, the fact that such explosive behavior and resulting meaninglessness occurs in logic at all further proves my thesis true and demands that the importance, validity, and applications of Nihilism and Paraconsistent Logic be fundamentally reexamined.

Finally, here is the argument:
> If paradoxes exist, then it is possible for paradoxes to exist.

1. I define existence as the totality of facts, things, and correlated representations. This definition of existence is similar to Ludwig Wittgenstein's definition of 'the world' defined in his **Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus** (TLP) as "the totality of facts, not of things." (TLP, 25, 1.1) See (5.33) for the relationship between facts, things, and their representations.

2. If it is possible for paradoxes to exist, then possibility is, in essence, paradoxical.
	- 2.1 Possibility is, in substance, Nothing.
3. If the essence of possibility is paradoxical then things based in possibility will exhibit paradoxical behavior or embody paradoxical essence.
	- 3.1 Paradoxical behavior and essence includes self reference, contradiction, conflict, or balance, found internally or externally in groups or individuals. ^0d2c73
4. All things that exist are inherently possible or based in possibility otherwise they would not exist: they would be a part of possibility and thus Nothing by (2.1).
5. Paradoxes do exist.
	- 5.1 By simply acknowledging the conceptual existence of paradoxes anywhere in this argument, then, by the logic of Descartes’ Ontological Argument, paradoxes necessarily exist, and (5) is proved true.
		- 5.11 This is not to say that paradoxes are a ‘supremely perfect being’ or that they are ‘perfections,’ but it is to say that in order to deny the existence of paradoxes one must first accept paradoxes or impossible contradictions exist in such a way that they can be denied, even conceptually.
		- 5.12 So, this act of denying the existence of paradoxes is contradictory because they must exist within the act of denying their existence. In other words, paradoxes conceptually exist in a manner comparable to how Descartes conceptualizes God in his Ontological Argument, and, as such, it is impossible to coherently deny their existence.
			- 5.121 If paradoxes did not exist then they would be Nothing, by (4), and we would subsequently lack words to describe them and their being, as they would not be.
			- 5.122 (3.1) would be nonsensical if paradoxes did not exist.
		- 5.13 Therefore, by (5.12) paradoxes do exist, proving (5), because it is impossible to deny their existence without acknowledging that they do existence in some manner, however conceptual.
	- 5.2 According to [Gilles Deleuze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBo2Z7ZV0As&feature=emb_logo), a paradox is a proposition that consists of presenting the unthinkability of a thing.
		- 5.21 Necessitated by (1.1), I define a proposition consisting of presenting the unthinkability of a fact to be a paradox of equivalent essence.
	- 5.3 Bertrand Russell interprets Wittgenstein's main thesis of the TLP to be, “That which has to be in common between the sentence and the fact cannot, so [[Wittgenstein]] contends, be itself in turn said in language.” (TLP, 8)
		- 5.31 In other words, language as sentences used to describe the facts of reality will always fail to __completely__ verbalize the equation between description and fact.
		- 5.32 This failure of language shows that the creation of sentences to describe reality or the commonality between language and existence is continually __incomplete__. In the TLP, Wittgenstein articulates how this incompleteness of language can result in the misunderstandings and incorrect logical pictures that Philosophy seeks to resolve as a discipline.
		- 5.33 Though the facts and things that exist can be represented by sentences and logical pictures—and regardless of how well correlated a sentence or logical picture is to a extant thing or fact—that linguistic description or logical picture is not and will never be the fact or thing it describes.
		- 5.34 This incompleteness of language—the descriptions and representations correlated to things and facts that do not exist, or do not exist yet—is essentially and necessarily unthinkable.
	- 5.4 Russell goes on to explain how Wittgenstein proposes that language is the “logical structure” that allows us to form 'logical pictures' of facts, which Wittgenstein, “says is a Gedanke” or ‘thought’. (TLP, 9) I interpret this as meaning language is the technology or medium of thought.
	- 5.5 Due to the failure of language described by (5.31), every sentence, or—by (5.4)—thought, that comes into being is essentially incomplete by (5.32). Thus, by (5.34), all sentences and thoughts are intrinsically propositions that present objects or concepts that are unthinkable to others, or were unthinkable until they were thought.
	- 5.6 Therefore, by (5.2), (5.21), and (5.5), all sentences and thoughts are paradoxes, further proving (5) to be true.
 6. Thus, by (2), (3), (4), and (5) all things that exist are paradoxical in their existence and nature, described by (3.1).
