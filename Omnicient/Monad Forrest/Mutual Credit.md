# Mutual Credit 

- ## Semantics Overview
    - ### Differentiations
        - Interior/Exterior
        - Subjective/Objective
        - Valuation/Accounting
        - Responsibility/Accountability
        - Credit/Debt
        - Positive sum/Zero sum
        - Gifting/Market
        - Transfer/Exchange
        - Open System/Closed system
        - Access/Ownership
        - Qualitative/Quantitive
        - Propose an Offer/Agree to a Request
- ## Abstract
    - ### Credit/Debt
        - Mutual credit in real life is full of nuance and lots of dependencies. The term "mutual credit" in itself is very misleading because the other side of credit (debt) is overlooked and zero sum mechanics are assumed to be positive simply because of the name - this is not necessarily true and is a dangerous assumption. 
    - ### Valuation/Accounting
        - In particular, the polarity of valuation and accounting is interesting. It seems that mutual credit is largely thought of in terms of double entry accounting which is not a silver bullet. This works in accounting for items but when you start valuing things and exchanging items we need to acknowledge subjectivity. Subjective valuation is something that needs articulation by both agents in order to make an exchange. 
    - ### Gifting/Market 
	- ### Transfers/Exchange
		- Gifts are one way transfers to parties you know and trust. Market based exchanges are for dealing with untrusted entities.  
		- Starting from a gifting perspective is probably a better foundation for bootstrapping global economic systems, this is because it's a positive sum dynamic rather than zero sum. However market dynamics are probably necessary to be useful for mass adoption. 
   - ### Access/Ownership
		- **It makes the sense to gift access while retaining ownership; this gift creates surplus value while accounting for and tracking the resource. **
		- Part of this surplus value might be transvested into a commons! (further detail needed)
- ## Methodology
    - This is a complex system, each dependancy creates further dependencies. Many nodes will have n-dimensional edges; thus **scoping is required**. Ideally we **start with the smallest scope possible** and gradually increase the complexity (aka "feature creep"). The below specification assumes these qualities
- ## Horizons
    - ### Horizon 1
        - Offer/request resource access as a gift
        - Debit/credit resource
            - No valuation of gifted access
            - Accounting for resource
            - QR code handshake
    - ### Horizon 2
        - Value gift as a receiver
        - Async transaction capabilities
            - Button has more attack surfaces than a QR code
    - ### Horizon 3
        - LendCollateral
