Thinking Correctly: Integrated Trivium and Quadrivium a.k.a. Classical Education  
  
- The goal of a classical (Trivium-based) education was to teach students “how” to think (not “what” to think), resulting in an autodidactic (self-taught) society. A society of “thinkers.” These tools of learning could be applied to any subject encountered. In contrast, modern education teaches “what” to think by focusing on “subjects” or “skills,” resulting in a compliant society. A society of “workers.”  
- Today’s modern method of education was imported from Prussia and [first implemented as the American education system in Massachusetts in 1852](http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Horace](http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Horace?fbclid=IwAR28eVbY59SaCFVJsdInmkdniZ5LY155PVLhwI6Wgi3UKW6iHJagfRqTQfo) Mann. Designed for militaristic purposes [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system?fbclid=IwAR0Q1nrZi4leTBq9k-pAjYUxAafEgmeO3ccqVVFPa2ZRW0Kr71MNP7yPzPw) after the defeat of the Prussians [Germans] by Napoleon at the battle of Jena in 1806. The Prussians believed that the battle was lost because the Prussian soldiers were thinking for themselves on the battlefield instead of following orders.  
- The Prussian method of education provided only the skills needed for an industrialized world (reading, writing and arithmetic), and a strict education in ethics, duty, discipline and obedience. Affluent children often went to preparatory private schools (which taught the Trivium-based classical education) for an additional four years, but the general population had no access to secondary education.  
  
The Trivium (The Elementary Three of Classical Education; 1-Grammar, 2-Logic and 3-Rhetoric)  
The word “trivium” comes from the Latin prefix “tri” meaning “three,” and the Latin root “via” meaning “way,” or “road.” The word means “the three-fold way or road.” The trivium refers to the three stages, or ways, of learning that also coincide with a child’s cognitive development. These three paths of knowledge are fundamentally interconnected and are considered preparatory and essential for learning the Quadrivium (the secondary four of Classical Education).  
  
The Trivium  
1. Grammar (grammar stage) or Knowledge – Learning the body of knowledge of a subject. (Answers the question of Who, What, Where, and When). Grammar is the first building block to integrated, objective knowledge. The body of knowledge, when gathered and arranged under the rules of general grammar can then be subjected to logic for full understanding, which is a separate intellectual procedure.  
  
2. Logic (dialectic stage) or Understanding – Learning to reason. (Answers the question of Why). Logic or reasoning is practiced by establishing valid (non-contradictory) relationships among facts, leading to systematic understanding. This tool is used for thinking correctly; without contradiction (includes the identification of logical fallacies. See previous Blogs on fallacies Part 1 and 2). The goal of logic is proof and consists of establishing the truth and validity of a concept or proposition in agreement with objective, factual reality. Note: The body of knowledge learned in the grammar stage is used to practice reasoning in the Logic (dialectic) stage. In the Logic stage we try to understand the facts we learned in the grammar stage.  
  
3. Rhetoric (rhetoric stage) or Wisdom – Learning the science of non-violent communication and the art of expression. (Provides the How of a subject). Rhetoric or Wisdom is the application and expression of knowledge and understanding (conclusions reached from the prior stages of grammar and logic) on a subject. 

**Summary**: In the grammar stage the facts are learned; in the logic (dialectic) stage we began to understand those facts, and in the rhetoric stage we learn to express what we now understand.  
  
There are two ways to look at the Trivium: 1-the learning stages that correspond to a child’s cognitive development, and, 2-the natural process that is followed when a person of any age learns something new.  
  
The first way is the definable progression of a child’s development. In the first stage (grammar [memorization of facts], corresponds to the elementary grades) there is a natural affinity for storing up substantial amounts of information on a variety of subjects, from nursery rhymes to math facts, and recalling that information at will. The next stage (logic or dialectic [understanding and analytical thinking], corresponds to the junior high grades), the ability to reason is refined, and facts learned in the grammar stage are used as an exercise in argumentation. The last stage (rhetoric [expression and abstract thinking], corresponds to the high school grades), self-discovery and expression are the focus, and cognitive abilities reach their full maturity.  
  
The second way to look at the Trivium is that anyone learning something new goes through these same three stages. A baby learning language starts with vocabulary (the grammar stage), advancing to stringing the words together in a meaningful way (the dialectic stage), and ends with expressing thought through language usage (the rhetoric stage.) An adult learning something new does the same thing: learns the vocabulary, the rules, the basics of the subject (grammar), strings the facts together to reach understanding (dialectic), then demonstrates or expresses knowledge of the subject (rhetoric.)  
  
Using the Trivium to Examine Issues  
- The Trivium can be used to examine issues and subjects by breaking them down into (grammar) concrete facts and rules, (logic) abstract comprehension and reasoning, and (rhetoric) application and expression.  
- The Grammar of a subject is its basic facts and fundamental rules. For example, the Grammar of Math includes the numbering system and basic Math facts. The Grammar of History includes names, dates and places.  
- The Logic of a subject is the comprehension of how its facts fit together logically. For example, the Logic of Math is Algebra and Geometry. The Logic of History is recognizing the “why” of names, dates, and places such as understanding reasons for wars, cultural tendencies and political revolutions.  
- The Rhetoric of a subject is its expression and application. For example, the Rhetoric of Math is the application of mathematical study to the practices of accounting or engineering. The Rhetoric of History is accurately communicating ideas about subjects such as political science and cultural trends.  
- This method of breaking down subjects into grammar, logic, and rhetoric is repeated each time new information is introduced about a subject. This promotes further examination of that subject, and provides additional understanding.

- The ancient Greeks separated the arts into two categories: practical arts, which prepared one for craftsmanship and trade; and liberal arts, which focused on the intellectual and moral development of an individual. Liber comes from the Latin word for “free.” Liberal Arts education was designed to prepare individuals to be free thinkers in contrast with a vocational education, which prepares people to be skilled workers in a particular trade.  
- Classical education is language-focused; learning is accomplished through words, written and spoken, rather than through images (pictures, videos, and television). Language-learning and image-learning require different habits of thought. Language requires the mind to work harder. When reading, the brain is forced to translate a symbol (words on the page) into a concept. When viewing images, such as those on video and television, the brain allows the mind to be passive. In front of a video screen, the brain can kick back and relax; faced with the written page, the mind is required to get to work.  
  
The Quadrivium (The Secondary Four of Classical Education; 4-Arithmetic, 5-Geometry, 6-Music and 7-Astronomy):  
- The word “quadrivium” comes from the Latin prefix “quad” meaning “four,” and the Latin root “via” meaning “way,” or “road.” The word means “the four-fold way” or “place where four roads meet.” The quadrivium was considered preparatory and essential for the serious study of philosophy and theology.  
  
The Quadrivium refers to the progression of the study of number and its relationship to physical space and time in this specific order:  
1. Arithmetic – Number in itself (pure number)  
2. Geometry – Number in space  
3. Music, Harmonics, or Tuning Theory – Number in time  
4. Astronomy or Cosmology – Number in space and time  
  
Plato learned the Quadrivium arts from the school of Pythagoras (whom it is suggested learned from the priestly schools of Egypt or Babylon). Plato promoted the Quadrivium in his works, The Republic and Laws, as the essential education for the philosopher. The study of the Quadrivium awakens the mind to the intrinsic order of the cosmos, freeing it from mere “shadows on the cave wall”. By studying these disciplines, the individual learns to recognize patterns and manifest ideas that underlie and integrate the universe in the realm of space and time. The end goal of the ancient scholars was the study of philosophy and theology. The Trivium and Quadrivium was preparation for that higher order of thought.  

In modern education the habit of “pattern” thinking has been replaced by “straight-line” thinking, and 
knowledge has lost its unity and interconnectedness.  
  
The Pythagorean Theorem and the 3-4-5 Triangle (a.k.a. “Integrated Trivium/Quadrivium”)  
  
The Pythagorean Theorem:  
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPythagorean_theorem%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3pthIoFnd2oRalQ886Lq2lyH_mMPH86_zXY8N_icwjdrrdyq1TSpU9UnE&h=AT2I6LNo8P09Q0PPpWPberaAPlEQAnJfhD_7qIHAhXLSNmO8rPrXNYXBXcZYQCh_7cjNfEMbvQJTxEz068K5EjdER7SYE2pHexeMDTui8n8a4yKR4Ws7UohN92lVuaExIQNA03g&__tn__=-UK*F)  
This theorem is referred to as the “root of all geometry and the cornerstone of mathematics.” In a right angled triangle (the longest side of a right triangle is called the hypotenuse): if you make a square on each of the three sides, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  
  
Pythagoras 3-4-5 Triangle:  
The ancients associated mystic meaning with numbers and considered the 3-4-5 the most beautiful triangle of all. The 3-4-5 triangle is the only right triangle with edges in arithmetic progression. An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For example, the sequence 3, 4, 5, is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 1. If the behavior of the progression is positive, the members will grow towards positive infinity.  
∞  
This triangle is prevalent in (primarily ancient) architecture throughout the world.  
  
One interpretation of the mystical quality of this special triangle is as follows:  
3 = Trivium – Classical Education (First 3 of the 7 Liberal Arts), 1-Grammar, 2-Logic and 3-Rhetoric.  
4 = Quadrivium – Classical Education (Next 4 of the 7 Liberal Arts): 4-Arithmetic, 5-Geometry, 6-Music and 7-Astronomy.  
5 = Senses – the methods of experience to learn. Taste, sight, smell, hear and touch.  
As stated in Part I, the goal of classical education was to teach “how” to think, not “what” to think, resulting in an autodidactic (self-taught) society. A society of “thinkers.” These integrated tools of learning could be applied to any subject encountered. In contrast, modern education teaches memorization, aka “what” to think, resulting in society of compliant “workers.”  
  
Is there a higher order of adepts using this knowledge to dominate our reality?
