# Transvestment

- **Overview**
    - **Where we are now**
        - The current state of affairs appears driven by externalities that typically incentivise short term extractive behaviours for immediate personal gain. Goods and services (products) are roughly accounted for at base price + margin (profit). Unchecked, the becomes pathological as wider forms of value are left unconsidered by the enclosable communication channel otherwise known as fiat currency.

        - Concrete example. Mr Robot Adam Smith Invisible hand moments
    - **Where we might want to be**
        - An idealised world might recognise more diverse forms of value and consider many of them as integral towards restoration of our humanity through affirmation of the symbiotic relationship we have with each other, the planet and cosmos. Such a system might be driven by an “abundance of access” rather than ownership.  
        - Rafi: we are the shepards of flows (currency design course)
        - Guillem: the upward spiral (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5thxvIdEds4)
    - **Assumptions about the stage in between**
        - To bridge the gap we are exploring a bare bones transvestment vehicle (smart contract system). In such a model the contexts around **provisioning (input) **and **appropriation (output)** should be taken into account. 
            - In this document **outputs** are **assumed** to have better efficiency than current implementations (via automation etc) which provide a cost-savings delta that could be exploited to realise a transition. (https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Transvestment)
            - The differential of these savings should perhaps be divided into three outputs; personal return (contribution rewards/action incentive), local returns (for the service/co-op/DAO), and global returns (protocol/new services) to create positive feedback loops and an exponent.

    - Capped returns
        - The implementation is pretty simple. Whenever a company issues shares, it writes a matching call option where it is required to repurchase the shares at an agreed upon price. 
        - In this model a company has two types of shares – **financial shares **which yield returns until they are repurchased, and **governance shares** which only have voting rights and do not expire. This is pretty simple to set up in a company constitution. 
        - When the financial shares are gone all that is left are the governance shares and now 100% of the profits from the venture are available for the organisation’s social mission. Capped return investments can also __dramatically change the risk profile__ of investing in an early stage business by agreeing on payment terms that are a share of revenue and __look more like a capped royalty than traditional equity__.
        - If capped returns became the norm of business then the growth path of a successful enterprise would be to pay back its founders and investors early on in its lifecycle (first decade or two). Then there would be a big celebration as the business became a freehold impact venture with a binding mandate to serve wider society

        - "If recognising the value of the product is linked to the distribution of the product, then both acts, production and use, are valuable. This way of linking emerging value to the organisation-building around the value might be interesting for businesses that are a) commonly owned and b) non-commercial." 
        - "The tokens are not payments for services or company stock, but rather sovereign notions of value produced in the interaction with and within the organisation." 
        - "The value can be anything from use/access rights and voting/curating rights to liquidity. Further on, the liquidity may be generated through the value offered by other organisations/networks or by the FIAT value generated by the project. This allows social values like free information or education an organisational form that individuals and institutions can rally around (give value)." 
        - "For instance, if Wikipedia would organise this way it could use the “wiki” interaction process where open knowledge is produced, curated and received, and recognise the value in all of them and produce incentives for collaboration via shared stakes. These stakes could be shares in the value that other organisations or individuals give to Wikipedia and/or curatorial rights for content. Such a currency system could also expand, so that the wiki currency could be also used to “fund” new articles by investing it in production proposals of new articles."
        -  "This gives the self-issued token two functions"
        - "Governance value in the project itself (internally generated value)"
            - Liquidity through 3rd party value recognition (externally generated value)
            - On 3rd party value recognition: 
            - • Boostrapping (Advanced speculative value)
            - • Production (Emergent realiesd value)
