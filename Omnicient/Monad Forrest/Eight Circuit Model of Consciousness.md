# Eight Circuit Model of Consciousness 

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-circuit_model_of_consciousness)

The **eight-circuit model of consciousness** is a hypothesis by Timothy Leary, and later expanded on by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [Antero Alli] that "suggested eight periods (circuits) and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution". 

The eight circuits, or eight "brains" as referred by other authors, operate within the human nervous system, each corresponding to its own imprint and direct experience of reality. Leary and Alli include three stages for each circuit that details developmental points for each level of consciousness.

Leary uses the eight "circuits" along with recapitulation theory to explain the evolution of the human species, the personal development of an individual, and the biological evolution of all life.

- **The first four circuits** deal with life on Earth, and survival of the species. 
- **The last four circuits** are post-terrestrial and deal with the evolution of the species, altered states of consciousness, enlightenment, mystical experiences, psychedelic states of mind and psychic abilities

The proposal suggests that these altered states of consciousness are recently realized, but not widely utilized. Leary describes the first four as "larval circuits", necessary for surviving and functioning in a terrestrial human society, and proposed that the post terrestrial circuits will be useful for future humans who, through a predetermined script, continue to act on their urge to migrate to outer space and live extra-terrestrially. Leary, Wilson, and Alli have written about the idea in depth, and have explored and attempted to define how each circuit operates, both in the lives of individual people and in societies and civilization. The term "circuit" is equated to a metaphor of the brain being computer hardware, and that the wiring of the brain as circuitry

#### Circuits
- 1. 
- [ ] 		(Leary)The vegetative-invertebrate circuit 
		(Wilson) The oral bio-survival circuit
		- This circuit is concerned with nourishment, physical safety, comfort and survival, suckling, cuddling, etc. It begins with one spatial dimension, forward/back.
		- This circuit is [imprinted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)) early in infancy. The imprint will normally last for life unless it is re-imprinted by a powerful experience. Depending on the nature of the imprint, the organism will tend towards one of two basic attitudes:
			- **A positive imprint** sets up a basic attitude of trust. The organism generally considers the environment benign and accepts and approaches. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're ok" in the 'life positions' model of [[Transactional Analysis]]
			- **A negative imprint** sets up a basic attitude of suspicion. The organism generally regards the environment as hostile and flees and avoids. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're not ok" in the 'life positions' model of [[Transactional Analysis]]
		- This circuit is said to have appeared in the earliest evolution of the invertebrate brain and corresponds to the reptilian brain of. This circuit operates in essentially the same way across mammals, reptiles, fish, primates and humans. 
		- [[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the oral stage in the Freudian theory of psychosexual development, and proposed that this circuit is activated in adults by strong opioids




- 2. 
		(Leary)The emotional-locomotion circuit 
		(Wilson) The anal territorial circuit
		- The emotional-territorial circuit is imprinted in the toddler stage. It is concerned with domination and submission, territoriality, etc.
		- The imprint on this circuit will trigger one of two states:
			- **Dominant**, aggressive behavior. This imprint creates an 'alpha' social attitude. Equivalent to the 'top dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm OK' in the 'life positions' model of [[Transactional Analysis]], and to master morality in the model of Friedrich Nietzsche
			- **Submissive**, co-operative behavior. Equivalent to the 'bottom dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm not OK' in the life positions model and to Nietzschean 'slave morality'.
		- This circuit is activated by depressant drugs such as alcohol barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. This circuit appeared first in territorial vertebrate animals and is preserved across all mammals. It corresponds to the mammalian brain of triune brain theory [[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the anal stage in the Freudian theory of psycho-sexual development. This circuit introduces a 2nd spatial dimension; up/down.
		- The first and second circuits both imprint in a binary fashion: trust/suspicion and dominance/submission. Thus there are four possible ways of imprinting the first two circuits:
			- Trusting 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. I'm OK; you're OK. 
				- Friendly strength in the Interpersonal Circumplex. 
				- Fire in the four elements model. 
				- Choleric in the four humors model.
			- Trusting 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. I'm not OK; you're OK
				- Friendly weakness. 
				- Water in the four elements model. 
				- Phlegmatic humor.
			- Suspicious 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. I'm OK; you're not OK
				- Unfriendly strength. 
				- Air in the four elements model. 
				- Sanguine humor.
			- Suspicious 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. I'm not OK; you're not OK
				- Unfriendly weakness. 
				- Earth in the four elements model. 
				- Melancholic humor.
- 3. 
		(Leary)The laryngeal-manual symbolic circuit 
		(Wilson) The semantic time-binding circuit
		- This circuit is imprinted by human symbol systems. It is concerned with language, handling the environment, invention, calculation, prediction, building a mental "map" of the universe, physical dexterity, etc.
		- This circuit is activated by [stimulant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant) drugs such as [amphetamines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine), [cathinones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathinone), [cocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine), and [caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine). This circuit supposedly appeared first when [hominids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominid) started differentiating from the rest of the [primates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primates).
		- [Robert Anton Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson), being heavily influenced by [General Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Semantics), writes of this circuit as the 'time-binding circuit'. This means that this circuit's contents – including human know-how, technology, science etc. - are preserved [memetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) and passed on from generation to generation, constantly mutating and increasing in sophistication.
- 4. 
		(Leary)The socio-sexual domestication circuit 
		(Wilson)The socio-sexual circuit
		- This fourth circuit is imprinted by the first [orgasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm)-mating experiences and tribal "morals". It is concerned with [sexual pleasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_pleasure) (instead of sexual reproduction), local definitions of "moral" and "immoral", [reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction), rearing of the young, etc. The fourth circuit concerns itself with cultural values and operating within [social networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society). This circuit is said to have first appeared with the development of tribes. Some have pointed out that [entactogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathogen-entactogen) such as [MDMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA) seem to meet some of the requirements needed to activate this circuit.
- 5. (Leary and Wilson)The neurosomatic circuit
		- This is concerned with neurological-somatic feedbacks, feeling high and blissful, somatic reprogramming, etc. It may be called the rapture circuit.
		- When this circuit is activated, a non-conceptual feeling of well-being arises. This has a beneficial effect on the health of the physical body.
		- The fifth circuit is consciousness of the [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body). There is a marked shift from linear visual space to an all-encompassing [aesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic) sensory space. Perceptions are judged not so much for their meaning and utility, but for their aesthetic qualities. Experience of this circuit often accompanies a [hedonistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) turn-on, a rapturous amusement, a detachment from the previously compulsive mechanism of the first four circuits.
		- This circuit is activated by ecstatic experiences via physiological effects of [cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)), [Hatha Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_Yoga), [tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra) and [Zen meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_meditation). [[Robert Anton Wilson]] writes, "Tantra yoga is concerned with shifting consciousness entirely into this circuit and that "Prolonged sexual play without orgasm always triggers some Circuit V consciousness".
		- Leary describes that this circuit first appeared in the [upper classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class), with the development of leisure-class civilizations around 2000 BC.
- 6. 
		(Leary)The neuro-electric circuit 
		(Wilson)The metaprogramming circuit
		- Note: Timothy Leary lists this circuit as the sixth, and the neurogenetic circuit as the seventh. In "Prometheus Rising", [[Robert Anton Wilson]] reversed the order of these two circuits, describing the neurogenetic circuit as the sixth circuit, and the metaprogramming circuit as the seventh. In the subsequently published "Quantum Psychology", he reverted this back to the order proposed by Leary.
		- This circuit is concerned with re-imprinting and re-programming all earlier circuits and the relativity of "realities" perceived. The sixth circuit consists of the nervous system becoming aware of itself. Leary says this circuit enables [telepathic communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy) and is activated by low-to-moderate doses of [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD) (50-150 μg), moderate doses of [peyote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyote), [psilocybin mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom) and meditation/chanting especially when used in a group or ritual setting. This circuit is traced by Leary back to 500 BC
- 7.
		(Leary)The neurogenetic circuit 
		(Wilson)The morphogenetic circuit
		- This circuit is the connection of the individual's mind to the whole sweep of evolution and life as a whole. It is the part of consciousness that echoes the experiences of the previous generations that have brought the individual's brain-mind to its present level.[__[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)__]
		- It deals with ancestral, societal and scientific [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)-[RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribonucleic_acid)-brain feedbacks. Those who achieve this mutation may speak of [past lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_lives), [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation), [immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality) etc. It corresponds to the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious) in the models of [Carl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) where archetypes reside.
		- Activation of this circuit may be equated with consciousness of the [Great God Pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)) in his aspect as Life as a whole, or with consciousness of [Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis), the biosphere considered as a single organism.
		- This circuit is activated by higher doses of [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) (200-500 μg), higher doses of [peyote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyote), higher doses of [psilocybin mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom), [[Yoga]] and [meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation).
		- The circuit first appeared among the [Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus) in the early first millennium and later reappeared among the [Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi_cosmology) sects.
- 8. 
		(Leary)The neuro-atomic metaphysiological 
		(Wilson)The non-local quantum circuit 
		- The eighth circuit is concerned with [quantum consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind), [non-local awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) (information from beyond ordinary [space-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time) awareness which is limited by the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light)), illumination. Some of the ways this circuit can get activated are: the awakening of [kundalini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_energy), shock, a [near-death experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience), [DMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine), high doses of LSD and according to [[Robert Anton Wilson]] almost any dose of ketamine. This circuit has even been compared to the [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist) concept of [Indra's net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net) from the [Avatamsaka Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatamsaka_Sutra)
