# Gestalt General [[Principals]]
#### Principle of Totality
- Conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) of dynamic relationships. Wertheimer described [holism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism_in_science) as fundamental to Gestalt psychology, writing "There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole." In other words, a perceptual whole is different from what one would predict based on only its individual parts.

-  Moreover, the nature of a part depends upon the whole in which it is embedded. Köhler, for example, writes "In psychology...we have wholes which, instead of being the sum of parts existing independently, give their parts specific functions or properties that can only be defined in relation to the whole in question." Thus, the maxim that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is not a precise description of the Gestaltist view. Rather, **"The whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing is a meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful."**

#### Principle of [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysical_parallelism) [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_(Gestalt_psychology)):
- Köhler hypothesized that there is a [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) between conscious experience and [cerebral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain) activity.)
 
 Based on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:
- ##### Phenomenon experimental analysis
	- In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take **phenomena as a starting point** and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.

- ##### Biotic experiment
	- The Gestalt psychologists established a need to conduct real experiments that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher [fidelity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity), what would be habitual for a subject.

##### Properties
- The key principles of gestalt systems are [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence), reification, [multistability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistability) and [invariance](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/invariance)
