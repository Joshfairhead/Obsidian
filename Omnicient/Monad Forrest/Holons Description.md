# Holons

    - Payment Flows, Liquid Renumeration, Appreciation, Holocratic Payments, Fractal, Liquid Pledging
- **Purpose**
    - To break down silos to enable scale-free peer 2 peer collaboration on projects and causes, while sharing rewards according to contribution.
- **Definition**
    - A holon is an evolving self-organizing structure, composed of other holons, whose structures exist at a balance point between chaos and order. A holon is simultaneously a whole in itself and at the same time is nested within another holon and so is a part of something much larger than itself. Holons range in size from the smallest subatomic particles and strings, all the way up to the multiverse, comprising many universes. Individual humans, their societies and their cultures are intermediate level holons, created by the interaction of forces working upon us both top-down and bottom-up.
- **Description**
    - Iteration 1
        - Collaborators can join together into an holon, a payment splitter on Ethereum,
        - Holons is an appreciative payment splitter. Each Holon has its own Ethereum address where ether and any ERC20 tokens can be sent.
        - Any sent value will be automatically split across its members.
        - In a way, it resembles shares within a traditional organization, where people automatically receives instantaneous dividends upon receiving funds sent towards it.
        - The fundamental difference is that the shares can't be purchased or are not set in advance, but computed at the moment of payment according to the appreciation shared and received by the holon members.
        - As members cannot send appreciation to themselves, we create an altruistic peer to peer signal that would highlight the people who have significantly advanced the project or have closely collaborated together.
        - Holons can be nested together:  for instance a marketing holon could receive funds from the appreciation sent over from the sales holon, and in turn it would be split the value to its members. And there is no limit to where a person can be: This means the same person can receive funds from multiple streams within the same organization, and also across different organizations.
        - In fact, organizations can also be nested into a scale-free organization: if f
        - Although holons can be created by anyone and do not need to be attached to category, we have created a global directory.
        - Funds can be send to the directory, where holons can appreciate other holons.
    - Iteration 2
        - Holons is a "liquid renumeration" dApp; the mechanism fundementally consists of a payment splitter that weights appropriation rights according to participant reputation thats termed "appreciation".
        - We use this terminology because appreciation is a yin "current-see", which means that its a non-scarce subjective quantifier that users use to 
- **Story:**
    - Iteration 1
        - Since the industrial revolution we've arguably enshrined a bias towards paradigms of objective quantification - which has lead to the creation of accounting tools which continuously shape our mindsets in this tradition. The most obvious of these is fiat currency.
        - Goodharts Law dictates "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"... So how do we avoid a flatland devoid of qualitative meaning? How can we broaden our perspectives? Can we integrate the interior dimensions of existence? How do we diversify a single target?
        - There is however a subjective signal that condenses a lot of qualitative assessments of collaborators: **Appreciation**.
        - People condense the positive interaction and the helpfulness of each other in their brain, and if asked, can give an approximated quantifiable measure for it.
        - We could use this as a signal to highlight how much members have cooperated, and thus how to split any eventual funds, prizes, grants, incentivising appreciation within and across teams.
        - Whenever funds are sent to the holon, they are split proportionally to the appreciation each member received. 
        - By nesting holons it is possible to form and coordinate purpose driven organizations of any size.
        - There is no longer a need to sign a contract. Just join the causes and projects you care about, contribute and get appreciated. Whenever a payment is received (Eg: a price money, a grant, commercial licenses), it will flow automatically through the entire holonic structure, rewarding the people 
        - Advantages:
            - 
    - Iteration 2
        - There are two realms of contribution; qualitative (subjective) and quantitive (objective)
            - In the realm of subjective quality; we must acknowledge that qualities are an emergent property of an interrelated schema - which is a potentially infinite list. 
            - In the realm of quantity; Peter Drucker states "what gets measured, gets managed", while Goodharts Law dictates that "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". 
            - Its our assertion that an integration of both realms is necessary.
            - If [[Open Source]] is all about contributions, we need to ask - how should we account for them? It's our assertion that an integration of both realms is necessary.
        - There are pros and cons to both approaches, but since the industrial revolution we've arguably enshrined a bias towards paradigms of objective quantification - which has lead to the creation of accounting tools which continuously shape our mindsets in this tradition. The most obvious of these is fiat currency.
        - The cryptocurrency community has made displacing this outdated system a rally cry, though the paradigm hasn't moved on much as evidenced in continued speculation and the exclusive barter of short term mediums of exchange (tokens). As such, we are potentially just recreating another form of [[Capitalism]].
        - Acknowledging this quantitive reality as a starting point, we can start to ask how to avoid creating a flatland devoid of qualitative meaning? And how can we broaden our perspective to be more inclusive of a plurality of values? 
        - To be inclusive of values, we must acknowledge the current paradigm, which is also become Ethereum's primary use case - payments. This is a specific objective quantification of value thats necessary for most people in todays socio-economic climate. **Our innovation lies in how we distribute this "payment".**
        - Subjective qualifiers are as numerous as there are Kudos on Gitcoin (and beyond!) with each of these issued as an emergent property of an action; this is a good start in creating a schema of qualities but perhaps too sparse to be considered a useful in their own right. So how can they be vertically integrated?
        - integral between the quantitative and qualitative realms, which paradoxically allows us to quantify subjective qualities in the very broadest sense!
        - In the ontology we are suggesting, **appreciation** is a signal which can integrate both the quantitative and qualitative realms. Using this single subjective signal paradoxically allows us to measure all subjective qualities in a very simple way. Kudos can be interpreted as binary appreciation, and as such can be easily 
        - **Introducing Holons!**
            - Our dApp Holons thus allows users to dish appreciation as a yin current-see, which is non-scarce subjective quantifier that acts as a generalised correlate for payment distribution. Doing care work for your hack team? Awesome, if people "appreciate" your efforts you will receive a proportional amount of the income according to the appreciation graph. Same thing goes for design, development, logistics, marketing etc. This setup allows for people to work across multiple teams and work wherever they are appreciated. Call it a karmic circle - do what you love, get paid when theres liquidity! :)
