#### Immunity Strategy: investing in firms that are immunities to menace firms
- Companies now using ESG to build portfolios. 1/3 of capital raised has an ESG component. Sustainability investing is up 42% between 2018 and 2020.
- > As more and more investors choose to tilt their investments towards sustainability-focused companies, the techtonic shift will accelerate further. ~ Larry Fink [[Quotes]] [[Fund Manager Persona]]
- Immunities kicking in
	- Twitter > Open web (less toxic comments)
	- Robinhood > Public (not selling order flow, warns about risk)
	- Google > Neeva (subscription search engine)

#### Dispersion: frictionless transfer of value from less competent legacy gatekeepers
- Globalisation > digitalisation > dispersion
- Investments
	- HQ > AirBnB / Better (from offices to real estate)
	- Education > Section4 / Multiverse (vocational training)
	- Healthcare > 98point6 / Measured
	- Trust in banks > Crypto (ledger = picks and shovels)
	- Dining/Rundle > Panera bread and digital food sales (limitless coffee subscription!)
		- Choice is a tax. Consumers don't want more choice, they want to be more confident in the choices they make.
		- Business model that ties itself to the clock due to our bad estimation of time

#### Investments
- Private 40%
- Public 40%
- Realestate 20%
- Time is expensive

#### Algebra of wealth
Focus x Stoicism x time x diversification = wealth
- Focus: find something your good at, don't hate and pays well
- Stoicism: how much you save, not make. Live below your means
- Time: perserverence
- Diversification: Kevlar 

#### Diversification
20/30/50% of funds to buy individual stocks when young. No more.
Create a long term strategy that uses index/robo advisors for security
China possibly has asymetric upside, with high risk.
