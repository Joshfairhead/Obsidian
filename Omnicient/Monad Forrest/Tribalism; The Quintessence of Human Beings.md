### Introduction

The aim of this conference is to explain that human beings are naturally tribal and how they always, sooner or later, organize their societies in a tribal way. My main reference about this topic is the highly recommended book Re-Tribalize Now! A Step-by-step guide to cultural renewal, written by Edred Thorsson. In this book you can find an historical review about how tribes arise and how work, in the past and nowadays. Edred Thorsson proposes a way to re- tribalization, so if you are interested in that, you will have a lot of information there. However, in this conversation I would like to speak only about what it really is a tribe and why humans are tribal and always will be. Quoting the preface of this book, we can say that:

- A tribe is not a cult, it is a community.  
- A tribe is not a commune, it preserves individual liberties.  
- A tribe is not a hate group, it is a mutual aid society.  
- A tribe is not a survivalist militia, it seeks only peaceful prosperity.

### Definitions

In order to understand why humans are tribal and how we have organized across the history, there are several concepts that should be into account. We have to speak about culture, myth, tribe (of course), Thorpe or village, clan, family, nation and race. Besides, we should mention how this groups have been ruled, so other important notions are chieftainship and kingship, republic, empire, confederation; and the difference between stamm and männerbund and between gemeinschaft and gesellschaft.

#### Culture

According to Hegel, we can say that all culture is about direct contact between and among human minds. A culture is made up by four elements:

1.  An ethnic element (based on sexual contact leading to birth of offspring).
2.  An ideological element (myths, rituals, ethical codes...)
3.  A linguistic element (the language used by a group and its particular way to use it)
4.  A material element (buildings, tools, art, clothing...)

The more autochthonous and authentic a culture is, the most it will reflect these elements unique to themselves.

#### Myth

The common myth is essential in order to maintain the cohesion of a tribe. Nowadays the word myth is misused as a synonym of “lie” but actually means the opposite. A myth is a transcendental truth. It is something which is eternally and permanently true and real. It is a system of thought and narrative that makes a higher sense out of experiences. That is why myths are written in a poetic form, because they are not literally describing the facts (as History does) but the transcendental truth beyond the time and space. In other words, myths are the things which never happened, but always are.

#### Tribe

Of course it is the most important concept that we have to define. According to the anthropology, a tribe is made up of a self-identified group of clans and families sharing a common history and tradition. This tradition could be linguistic, political, mythic or cultic. Normally, there is a mix of this elements in each tribal tradition. The tribes usually have a particular set of laws or traditions and are generally loyal to some leader or principle within or among themselves. They have different political or economic organizations, so we cannot establish a patron in this aspect. They may share nothing more than a general sense of common identity in good times, whereas they became disciplined and well-organized units in times of crisis or war.

Individuals do not generally join tribes directly, even though mostly tribes have the mythical figure of common ancestor or founder. In fact, they join families or bond with another individual who is part of a family or clan within the tribe.

#### Thorpe (Village)

Apart from tribes, there are another social and economic unit which have played an important role in human history. A Thorpe could be just a trading post or a small collection of shelters to house craftsmen and their families. People living in a villages might come from different tribes and clans, but they worked together cooperatively. In this sense, villages are useful for tribes because procure common services or products. Basically, a village started as a common marketplace and normally, in order to protect the trade, this area is consecrated to a common deity. As a common sanctuary, all the tribes around it will respect the area and that means it is a peaceful space in with there are no violence and as a consequence, interchanges are possible.

The villages have common institutions, normally with religious (care the sanctuary) and legal purpose (arbitrate in conflicts). The village is a good and productive thing, but it has been allowed to overstep its bounds. The problem started when this village increased their size, becoming cities. A city or civitas in Roman culture, imply the concept of civilization. That means a common myth based in citizenship which dissolve the tribal bounds. The next step were the

“world cities” such as Rome, Constantinople, London or New York. The current “global village” is a dystopian recipe for disaster.

#### Clan

Tribes are made up of clans. Clans are widely extended families which consider themselves descended from a common ancestor, either in biological fact or mythically. Clans are typically headed by a chieftain o patriarch who may be an authority figure or a symbolic or ceremonial head, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes, a clan could evolve into tribe once it has reached a big enough size.

#### Family

Avoiding the modern controversies about the concept of “family”, we will take it in the traditional sense. Historically, the family has been understood as an extended family, which descends from a single living patriarch (o matriarch) who is its titular head. The slaves, servants, low rank freemen who had made an oath of allegiance to the head of the family and even the pets were considered members of the family or, in a more general sense, members of the house. Families are organized into clans and clans are organized into larger tribes.

The Indo-European families are patrilineal. That fact can be appreciated in modern surnames like McDonald (Celtic) or Donaldson (Germanic), which in both case means “son of Donald”. In Spanish we have the suffix –ez, from Visigoth origin, which means the same (Pérez means “son of Pedro”, González means “son of Gonzalo”, and so forth). The traditional way to belong of a family, of course, is to be born into it. Individuals from outside the family can join it by marriage, adoption, or blood-brotherhood. The rules concerning membership in a family are determined by the family itself. Probably the most ideal manner in which to construct new tribes in current times should be to have families enter from the outside by means of an oath or contract.

#### Nation

Before the modern concept of nation-State, based in the Rousseau’s theory of national sovereignty, the idea of “nation” was very loosely defined for most people. In ancient times, nation basically means the sum total of all the tribes who spoke a more or less mutually intelligible language and worshipped the same deities. Historically, the loyalty was not expressed with the nation, but with the tribe. Nonetheless, when modern States arose, the nationality had become a sort of new tribal identity. In the current “global village”, even the nationality is dissolving in other pseudo-tribal identities associated with ideology, gender identity, sexuality or even the fandom of a cultural product. These pseudo-tribes arisen in the absence of real tribes could be taken as a proof of human nature is tribal. As modern nations

have been reduced to the ownership of an ID card, the word “nation” is a meaningless concept now. Then I prefer take the concept of Folk instead of nation if we are speaking in the traditional cultural sense.

#### Race

The race, as well as the gender or other items has biological, spiritual and psychological implication in the human personality. However, like happened with the modern concept of nation, in Europe it was not until the 19th century that the category of race began to command any kind of special loyalty. The modern materialist worldview has reduced the concept of race only to the biological sense, and modern racism is a consequence of pseudo-scientist theories elaborated in the 19th century with the intention of justified the colonial empires.

Historically, the contact and competition with other races in the same area often inspires antipathy. A strong external physical difference and the cultural difference too, normally provoke mutual suspicious among people when they have contact with others. However, the great problem in our current “global village” is the contact between people of different races has not a consequence of a natural development, but a result of social engineering. Politicians try to dissolve particular identities in order to create the unnatural concept of “citizen of the world”. The homogeneity of the population is a goal of this sinister cult of equality which started in 18th Century with the Enlightenment, but it has failed.

As an aside, it should be recognized that the West has recently developed an unhealthy obsession with the concept of race. This obsession manifests in way of racism or supremacist ideologies, but also in the desire of denial the fact that the races exists at all. The racialist’s obsession with favouring those who merely look like himself is the perfect corollary to the politically correct obsession with favouring people who look different. Both reveal fixation with external appearances, rather than internal realities. In the traditional world, what was important were matters of family, clan and tribe, not even nation, much less race.

#### Forms of Government

There are several forms of governance applied across the History. It could be say that the forms of government of the modern States are, in fact, a degeneration of this forms of governance, originally used by tribes or non-coercive societies. First of all, there is the chieftainship or kingship. Kingship could be considered a more elaborated form of chieftainship. In primal ages, tribes elected a chief, normally the best hunter, in order to lead the hunting party. Later, the role of the best hunter was assumed by the best warrior. However, the primal military monarchy was wrapped with a sacred clothes. The Germanic word king originally meant “a descendant of

good kin”. The king was elected by the tribal council upon the death of the previous king until the establishment of the “sacred royalty” concept. However, not all tribes had kings and the ancient king was at the beginning as much a spiritual or symbolic head as a political one.

In the Germanic world, the king was often a “high priest”, judge, and civic leader. That is what in the Icelandic Commonwealth, during the Viking Age, the head of the nation was a high priest instead of a king. It is the same thing in the Roman Catholic Church, because of the Pope is a high priest but also the king of Rome, head of the Vatican State. The most important thing is that a living symbol of unity and cohesion is a significant tool in order to create a tribe. Apart from this, kingship give us the principle of hierarchy, which is despised in the modern world, but it is essential for human beings. A leader has three sources of legitimate his (non-coercive) authority over any organization or society: position/office, charisma and knowledge.

Since the end of the First World War, the republican form of government is more popular than monarchy. However, the concept of republic comes from the Latin concept of res publica, meaning “public thing”. This abstract idea is the origin of the State itself, so less natural than the direct links of allegiance between the freemen and their leader. Nonetheless, there one thing of the republican idea which could be taken into account: the balance between powers. The typical republican institutions, like assemblies or councils, were part of the traditional Germanic monarchies, which are the origin of the medieval ones. That representative institutions do not be confused with democratic ones. Democracy is, in fact, the “mob rule”. The philosophers of the ancient Greek and Rome warned of danger of democracy, because the masses could be even more tyrannical than an individual.

About the concept of empire, we have in mind the idea of a great conqueror submitting other nations. This is because the word “emperor” came from the Latin imperator, meaning “commander-in-chief” of the armed forces; and the structure of Roman Empire is the model for the modern States. However, there are other Indo-European model for what an Empire is: the Persian Empire. In Persia there was the concept of shahanshah, meaning “king of kings”. This idea could be taken in our times because maybe the tribes should be united in order to have any chance in a world made up by great supranational powers. An Empire in that sense could be positive. The ideal imperial model is one that recognizes the independence and identity of various peoples or nations within the empire, but eliminates armed conflict between them, and brings them under a single system of commerce and military policy. A shahanshah is about leadership and vision, and imperator is about force and coercion. Very close to the idea and theory of Empire in its non-coercive sense, is the idea of confederation, such as Switzerland.

#### Stamm versus Männerbund

In ancient times, there were two kinds of historical associations among people. One was based in familiar and organic or biological relationship. This sort of groups are referred with the German term stamm, quite similar to the English concept of “tribe”. The other kind of association is referred to with the technical German word männerbund, which is commonly translate as “men’s society” or “men’s brotherhood”. The männerbund exists to accomplish a certain mission or purpose. They may involves education and certification of skills connected to a trade, or to warcraft or to knowledge. The männerbünde are not tribes, but sometimes a tribe arises from a männerbund.

#### Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft

Linked with the previous concepts, there are two ways of organizing people. The German term of gemeinschaft is based on the verbal element of gemein, meaning “common”. A Gemeinschaft is a community, people who have things in common, which includes every aspect of life. This is the family, clan and tribe. A Gesellschaft, on the other hand, is a body of “fellows” (German from Gesellen). It is a fellowship or company, a permanent or temporary corporation made up of people under specific leadership and dedicated to some special purpose or endeavour. Several examples of this kind of fellowships are the warriors’ bands, the merchant guilds or the military orders in the Middle Age. The leader of a tribe in current times should be something like a “community organizer”, whereas the leader of a fellowship should be more like a “master”.

#### History of Tribes

The biggest difference between re-tribalization and other utopian movements of the 20th century is that tribal organization is based on an ancient social values, rather than untested possibilities. Tribal society survived more time than greatest empires of the Antiquity and, of course, more than the time of modern States have been existing. In fact, there are still tribes in the modern world, such as the Central Asia steppes; the Native Americans, both in the North and in the South, who live in a traditional way; or in Africa. There is not true a State is necessarily more powerful than a tribe, as we can check in Afghanistan. In the Spanish conquer of America, the Aztec and Inca Empires fell very quickly, but the tribal people of the Amazonas resisted for a long time.

Religious communities like Mormons or the Opus Dei are good examples of re- tribalization. Sometimes there are communities organized totally apart from the modern world, like Amish. However, re-tribalization does not means necessarily a rejection of the modern facilities, just the rejection of modern worldview. We have a good example of tribal prevalence is compatible with high-tech society in Jewish people. Jews are, basically, a “tribal nation”. The

Jewish identity is based on tribal principles and that has allowed them to survive across the History in spite of great persecutions. Besides, Jewish culture is also an example of re- tribalization with the Haredi, the ultra-Orthodox Judaism.

The tribal nature of the human beings can be also appreciated in modern phenomena like “urban tribes”. This tribes arisen in the 70s, based on a particular aesthetic and music style, have all the elements of a tribe. Other example is the communities based on a common interest, like the fandom of a videogame, book, film... or even more recently, things like the cryptocurrencies. The supporters of a particular sport team have also a very strong sense of community. In this case, we can even found an example of männerbund with the radical supporters, so called hooligans. There are also “outlaw organizations” like Mafia, motorcycle gangs “1%ers” and so one, with the exactly same structure of this kind of societies in the past. But there is not only criminals who organize themselves in this way, we can find also “warriors’ bands” like martial arts crews, for instance. In Spain, we have the confraternities of penitents, linked with the Holy Week, which have a high social relevance.

#### Conclusion

Everything said above proofs that tribal organization is the natural way to organize societies for human beings. Maybe the current “tribes” are more ethereal and undefined than the past tribes. However, that happen with everything in our modern world. We live in a liquid society and almost nothing is solid, neither tribes. Nonetheless, like a river, the human nature will break through after being dry for a while.
