#### Work test instructions
- You will receive an invitation to the ClassMarker platform via email (subject: “Your login details for ClassMarker”)
- Log into ClassMarker
- When you’re ready, start the “Work Sample Test - EACH Program Director”
- When you’re done, submit (click “finish” twice to confirm)
- Note: you cannot interrupt the test and you cannot copy-paste text into the answer boxes. Do not close your browser tab, as your answers will not be saved.
- Our goal is to get an insight into how you think and work, not to have polished text - bullet points and rough thoughts are fine. Focus on depth rather than polish.

#### Video interview
- The interview will be with two members of the EA Switzerland staff or board. It is semi-structured (we prepare questions and ask follow-ups). You will have five minutes to ask questions.

#### Coworking trial
- The coworking trial will be via video together with Naomi Nederlof. From her, you will receive instructions at the beginning of the session.
