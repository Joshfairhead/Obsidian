## Reflections on Climate x Blockchain jam at [[Fullnode]]:

The "jam" was really nicely facilitated. The gathering felt demonstrative of the healthy modes of human interaction fertilised with interesting subject matter. It felt wholesome and nourishing. Thankfully - given the name - there was very little ideology present; instead it was full of intelligent and mindful humans focused on their various domains of praxis. As such, the jam covered a lot of ground; crypto primitives like NFT's and DAO's synthesised with Ostroms work on the commons, embedded/nested ecosystems, digital monitoring and enforcement (penalties), restorative justice/forgiveness as modse of rehabilitating institutions, retroactively funding public goods and so forth. In general it was a nice info set that was permeable to people not holding esoteric knowledge. Anything that came up was nicely integrated into the discussion by the "host" and it felt like there was continuity throughout, the first few hrs were basically used to establish a ground of participant context and then as time went on, others from the Embassy network started to show up bringing with them their contexts. This helped shift gears a bit and elevate the conversation to the more wild ideas (like preempting space law in relation to environmentalism in the anthropocene). The whole event felt like quite a performance, and particularly during the later hours it felt like there was a more "immanent" modality present.
