# Ethics
## Non-relative Ethics

>The study of ethics is ultimately about identifying and applying the principles of effective choice. It is not about whether any given choice is 'right' or 'wrong' in some absolute sense. Only morality can be considered in such a binary (unconscious) manner.

----
### Principals

> To consider how to increase the effectiveness of one's choices is to determine what is meant by simultaneously preserving the integrity and increasing the potentiality of both life and evolution. To maximize potentiality and integrity is to maximize the combination of symmetry and continuity in the relationships between self (the subjective) and reality (the objective).

> Value, meaning, and purpose of expressions (choices and events), with an emphasis on meaningfulness. [[Triads]]

> The absolute _principles_ of ethics are common to all of consciousness (all individuals). The absolute _practice_ of ethics is particular and unique to each individual; it cannot be prescribed from without.

> To the extent that a moral code defines some things as "good" (valued, of virtue) and others as "bad" (some actions as right and others as wrong), there exists the risk of being inherently unethical in proportion to the degree that the boundary between the good and bad is 'sharp' (an expression of discontinuity). Systems of morality which are defined in 'black and white' terms are fundamentally antithetical to life and consciousness and are to be avoided. ~[[Forrest Landry]]

> **The Principle of Ethical Symmetry**:
Where the objective/external context is different,  
and where the subjective/internal context is the same,  
the content of expression shall be the same.

>**The Principle of Ethical Continuity**:
Where the objective/external content is different,  
and where the subjective/internal content is the same,  
the context of expression shall be the same.

> _All that is without choice, change, and consequence is illusion.  
Only that which is at once choice, change, and causality is **real**._

> One chooses most effectively when choosing (and continuing to choose) from one's deepest basis of desire. The best choices express that desire in a manner which is affirming to all of life at all levels of being.
> - ** This principle of effective choice continues to apply regardless of the level of intensity involved in that choice. In making choices of high intensity, a corresponding level/degree of integrity is required. **

### Judgement
> One is permitted, empowered, and required to respond to an action affecting oneself (to act on) with a similar level of intensity as the degree to which one has been acted upon (neither much more nor much less). The key to this principle is to act in a manner that is perfectly transformative, rather than a manner which is merely reactionary.

> To implement 'justice' is an attempt to personally act 'on behalf of', or 'in place of', natural causality. Ultimately, this must be understood as a lack of trust.
	> - For example; To claim that one is judging and enacting justice (or vengeance) 'in the name of X' is to imply that X would not otherwise choose, support, or intervene/act in agreement with the chosen moral code (a religious or civil law). Any activity (for example, the 'righteous' condemnation of others) that is 'justified' on the basis of religious convictions is ultimately founded on the _absence_ of religious conviction. All 'religious wars' are categorically not based on having religion; they are due to an absence of religion.

> The process of communication is best facilitated when each participant freely, honestly, and fully grants to the other these three rights:
> - 1) the right to speak,  
> - 2) the right to be understood, and  
> - 3) the right to know that one has been understood.
> 
> Communication between people does not happen unless and until all three of these rights have been (at least implicitly) granted from each to the other. These rights of communication cannot be taken; they can only be given.

#### Desire
>The meaning of a surface desire is clarified when its foundation in deeper desires is known. When surface desires appear to be in conflict, the knowledge and realization of one's deeper desires will always resolve that conflict.

>When desires are confused (i.e., are internally conflicting or are unclear), or when one has conflicting ideas and beliefs, one has effectively become two smaller selves, each of which has significantly less freedom of choice. One chooses most effectively when choosing as a unified self, as a whole being.

>There are two ultimate desires inherent in all being:
>- The desire to create and be creative (the expression of self-quality).  
>- The desire to experience and have experiences (the perception of form).

>The most basic desire inherent in all consciousness is to maximize the degree (quantity), diversity (quality), and intensity of both the creative experience and the experience of creativity.

> The degree of effectiveness of one's choices is proportional to the product of the degree to which one's choices and their results, coherently maintain, sustain, enhance, and nurture:
> 1) the integrity and wholeness (the actuality and actualization) of the world, the self, and the relation between world and self, and,
> 2) the potentiality/realization/evolution of creativity and experience in all of life, including one's own life (the degree to which it potentiates other choices).
> 
Quality is as important as quantity. Potentiality (what could happen) is as important as actuality (what does/did happen).

> To effect positive change is to 1) help all others (everyone) to know their real desires, and 2) to cooperatively help discover the most effective method for their realization. To make positive change is to help everyone act on the basis of what is wanted, (or needed, or desired) so as to get what is wanted/needed/desired, rather than on the basis of what is not wanted or feared.

#### Joy/Pain
> Pain corresponds to the actuality of events of interruption, cessation, discontinuity or disconnection in flow. These events decrease apparent potentiality. All pain is a reflection (a realization) of discontinuity. Pain occurs when there is a break, breach, or sudden change. Joy corresponds to the potentiality of events of connection, continuity, and union.  These are events which increase the feeling of potentiality.
>- It cannot not seem that the outer world is defined by experiences of discontinuity.  
>- It cannot not seem that the inner self is defined by expressions of continuity.

> **Where the degree of the intensity of the interaction between self and world changes, there will be (cannot not be) either joy or pain or both.**

> One's actions, interactions, and expressions in a world have maximum effectiveness when equal attention is given to: 1) the intensity, 2) the feeling, and 3) the forms of the conscious choices which compose them.

#### Choice
> For ones own choice to be free and truly self-determined, there must be an allowance for it to be truly without external influence and without reason.

> Limitation and freedom always occur together; they are inseparable. Never does a freedom occur without a limitation, and never does a limitation occur without a freedom. In being, any realization of either of the concepts of freedom and limitation implies the complete realization of the other.

> The degree of individual freedom in a society increases dramatically in proportion to the degree of cooperation among individuals. A society or culture is strong to the degree that _everyone_ is allowed to live creatively and live together.

> A maximum of both acceptance and expression, unity and diversity, is necessary for a nation (society, tradition, religion, culture) to be strong. Diversity must be accepted and unity must be expressed. The strength of a nation is known as much through its flexibility and tolerance as through its commitments and follow-through.

^086b10

>**Ethics (continuity) is best realized when the react/response ratio is near to unity (1 to 1). The greatest levels of effectiveness are attained when there is a balance between affect and effect. The maximum effectiveness (world health) is obtained when the wisdom with which one chooses is equal to the degree of consequence associated with that choice.**

>**To be responsible** as the being of oneself, one must choose and respond (act), rather than to react and reject (to be in false judgment). To be responsible is to sit in consciousness rather than merely in conscience.

### [[Culture]] and [[Values]]
>- Cultures/religions with an omniscient focus place the highest value on objectivity and understanding. They are ultimately values of _wisdom and intelligence_. (Examples; Science, Technology, Materialism, Capitalism).
>- Cultures/religions with a transcendent focus place the highest value on the hereafter and otherworldly. They are ultimately values of _mysticism and spirituality_. (Examples; Christianity, Buddhism, other organized and institutionalized religions).
>- Cultures/religions with an immanent focus place the highest value on the here and now, life and living in the present. They are ultimately values of _nature and community_. (Examples; Gaia or Earth consciousness, Paganism, tribalism).

> All three values are needed and are mutually supporting and affirming. Holding any one value over the other two results in imbalance and suffering. Maximum effectiveness occurs when there is a balance among these three primary value systems.
>- Where there is an excess of a transcendent emphasis in a culture, there is a tendency to justify the means in terms of the ends. This leads to much unnecessary worldly suffering, cruelty, strife, and war.
>- Where there is an excess of a omniscient emphasis in a culture, there is a tendency to invalidate the meaningfulness and significance of life (that which does not sustain life is not itself sustained). This can result in an (over) emphasis on separation, isolation (man from nature), and valuing the mundane over the sacred.
>- Where there is an excess of an immanent emphasis in a culture, there is a tendency towards excessive individuality, lack of vision, and over-consumption (a realization of cancer).

### The path of right action
> _The path of right action_ is a realization of the self-supporting dynamics of effective choice. Once on this path, one lives in dynamic balance: participating, creating, and experiencing; one acts with a clarity which is both internal and external.

### Choice and Intuition
> Reason and Intuition are not in opposition; they are mutually reflective, complementary aspects of a deeper whole. To have intuition is to embrace the unknown and the unknowable, rather than to be rejecting the factual/known.

> Reason can provide only a partial basis for effective (ethical) choice. It is also necessary to make a careful, deep, and honest evaluation of the totality of one's feelings.

>  No effective choice can be made only on the basis of reason alone; feeling must be involved also. All natural choices involve some elements of reason and some elements of that which is unknown and/or unknowable. Choice works best when both feeling and thought are in an intimate mixture with one another, especially _after_ validating that each can stand completely on its own without the other.

> When one is whole, healthy, knows fully and with clarity, and accepts unreservedly the totality of one's feelings and thoughts on all levels of being, the choices one makes in accordance with those feelings and thoughts will be at once wholly ethical and wholly effective.

> Both thought and feeling, truth and opinion, are to be applied together in fullness to attain efficient, effective ethical choices that are consistent with one's personal Path of Right Action.
