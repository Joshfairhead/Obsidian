# Bicameralism
**Bicameralism** (the condition of being divided into "two-chambers") is a controversial hypothesis in psychology and neuroscience which argues that the human mind) once operated in a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be "speaking", and a second part which listens and obeysâ€”a _bicameral mind_, and that the evolutionary breakdown of this division gave rise to consciousness in humans. The term was coined by Julian Jaynes, who presented the idea in his 1976 book _The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_ wherein he made the case that a bicameral mentality was the normal and ubiquitous state of the human mind as recently as 3,000 years ago, near the end of the Mediterranean bronze age.
