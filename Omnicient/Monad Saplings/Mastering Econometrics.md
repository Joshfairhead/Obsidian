# Mastering Econometrics

- Ceteris Paribus = (all) other things equal
- Counterfactual path = Potential but unrealised path
- Facts not in dispute but interpretation 
- Selection bias
- Furious five
    - Randomised trials
        - Random assignment of group membership
        - Often impractical and expensive
        - Measures "treatment effects"
        - Clear questions result in clear answers. Measurement definition.
        - **Law of large numbers**
            - In large samples the sample mean is almost certain to be close to the population mean.
            - A balance check is often warranted to ensure no selection bias 
            - Treatment effect is the difference between control group and treatment group
            - Sampling variance is expressed in a number called standard error
            - Statistical significance
                - When treatment effect is more than double the standard error, the chances of it being wrong are low (~1:20) 
    - Regression
        - Controlling for a set of variables
        - Can be subject to omitted variable bias (OVB)
            - Selection bias in a regression context
            -
