#### What does it take to shift consciousness?
- There’s research showing it is 10% from the University of Rochester Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. [http://Rpi.edu](http://rpi.edu/)

#### Italian housing statistics
- According to Istat, out of 31 million homes, over 7 million homes are EMPTY. We are talking about 23%, almost one in four houses. With peaks of 40% in Calabria and 50% in the Aosta Valley. Yet, according to a very conservative estimate, over 50,000 people in Italy are homeless and live (and die) on the street. In fact, if we consider immigrants and illegal immigrants, homeless people are many, many more. Still according to Istat, almost 20% of Italians live below the poverty line, and of these 7% live in conditions of absolute poverty, that is, they do not have access to the minimum resources to survive, according to European standards. We are talking about over 4 million Italians who do not have enough food, water, clothes and shelter to guarantee a quality of life worthy of the name, or at least comparable to the rest of the Italian population. This despite the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita being over 30,000 Euros per year. Beyond the (little) realistic and meaningful value that GDP can represent, this however makes us note two things: There is a very strong disparity between social classes, with very few rich people and a flood of poor people. According to Oxfam, 20% of the wealthiest Italians own 60% of the wealth, while 20% of the poorest Italians only hold 0.4% of the wealth. To make a comparison, the richest have an average per capita GDP of over € 100,000 per year, while the poorest have a per capita GDP of € 700 per head per year. It means that 20% of the wealthiest Italians have access to 14,000 times more wealth, money and resources than the poorest Italians. In fact, since we know that tax evasion is concentrated in the wealthiest segment of Italians, this disparity is much more serious than that.
