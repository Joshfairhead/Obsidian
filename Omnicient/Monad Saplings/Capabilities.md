# Capabilities
Capabilities are a security paradigm that is inverse to the permissions model. They are "bearer tokens" which grants holders certain abilities. A key to ones house is a good example, the owner holds the property rights but by passing the door key they can extend access to others. If they lend the only copy, they may end up locked outside and unable to enter. 

We are now moving into the age of extended capabilities; infact [[Douglas Englebart]] believed it the only way to deal with humanities intractable problems. We extend our capabilities through interfaces such as the keyboard > Text editors > Vim. Learn [[Dvorak]] as a foundation.
