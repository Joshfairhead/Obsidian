# Hoare Logic

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic)

**Hoare logic** (also known as **Floyd–Hoare logic** or **Hoare rules**) is a [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system) with a set of logical rules for reasoning rigorously about the [correctness of computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_of_computer_programs). It was proposed in 1969 by the British computer scientist and [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic) [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare), and subsequently refined by Hoare and other researchers. The original ideas were seeded by the work of [Robert W. Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Floyd), who had published a similar system for [flowcharts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart).
