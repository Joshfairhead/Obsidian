## Workflow
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewhfok91AdE)
- Incoming content
- Idea Distillation
- Produce Artifacts

### Tags vs pages
-   Tags are meta-information about the content, they tell me what kind of note it is, or what its status is, or what context it belongs to, not what itâ€™s about. `#article`, `#recipe`, `#person`, `#meeting`, etc.
-   [[pages]] are for entities, or subjects. `[[Digital Physics]]`, `[[New Orleans Shrimp]]`, `[[Ted Nelson]]`, `[[A Clockwork Orange]]`, `[[January Board Meeting]]`, etc.
-  Tags can be confusing when they are not identifying 'has' or 'is'. For instance; `hasPrincipals` vs `isPrincipal` - when these mix you get assorted results. Best to think of them as substances rather than accidents so `isPrincipal`. The note should only be about one thing! ~[[Josh]]

### Taking notes

- Take [[Evergreen Notes]]
- [[Evergreen Notes should be Atomic]]
- [[Evergreen Notes should be concept-oriented]]

[[Take notes to capture insight]]
