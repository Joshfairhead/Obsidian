# Obsidian Workflows

### Structure
- Using [[Forrest Landry]]s metaphysics as a template. Immanent for active work in the present tense; non-evergreen notes. Omnicient for information and intelligence. Trancendental for insights and [[Evergreen Notes]].

### Tags
- Tags are for classes. Meta-data about what kind of note I'm taking. Someone else suggested:
	- Tags are meta-information about the content, they tell me what kind of note it is, or what its status is, or what context it belongs to, not what itâ€™s about. `#article`, `#recipe`, `#person`, `#meeting`, etc.
	- [[pages]] are for entities, or subjects. `[[Digital Physics]]`, `[[New Orleans Shrimp]]`, `[[Ted Nelson]]`, `[[A Clockwork Orange]]`, `[[January Board Meeting]]`, etc.
- Tags can be confusing when they are not identifying 'has' or 'is'. For instance; `hasPrincipals` vs `isPrincipal` - when these mix you get assorted results. Best to think of them as substances rather than accidents so `isPrincipal`. The note should only be about one thing!

### Taking notes
[[Take notes to capture insight]]
[[A good note taking system should have levels of scale]]

- [Building a second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb)
- Take [[Evergreen Notes]]
	- [Principals](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) of [[Evergreen Notes]]
	- [[Evergreen Notes should be Atomic]]
	- [[Evergreen Notes should be concept-oriented]]
	- [[Evergreen Notes should be Densely Linked]]
	
### HotKeys
Basics:
- Highlight + Cmd + Delete = retain highlight, delete everything on the line infront

My custom setup: 
- Cmd + arrows = move cursor to line beginning/end
- Alt + arrows = move cursor one word left/right
- Shift + arrows = navigate History
- Shift + Cmd + Arrows = move panes

### [[Git]] Syncing
- Create a `.gitignore` file with folder paths (for teams) or use `.git/info/exclude` file for wore private git ignores. See note on [[Git]] for further info.
- Upload to github
