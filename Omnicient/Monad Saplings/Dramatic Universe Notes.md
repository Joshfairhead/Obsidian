The acceptance of a thorough-going relativity requires that we should always remember that we can know only partial truths, and that each fresh attempt to set up a system of universal validity is nearly always to build in the void, and the result, as the Russian proverb says, is only "To pour from empty into empty".

For the deepening of meanings, we need to return again and again to experience and thereby to enrich the content of our language. The method is that we have called progressive approximation; for its aim is rather to discover and express the meaning of what is already known than to seek for new discoveries. When this method is followed, the new and the old are given equal significance and the task of the investigator is to select, to eliminate, and to refine; so that the meaning of what remains should be clear and, being clear, can be understood. The process is neither analytic nor synthetic. It does not consist either in drawing conclusions from what is already known or in seeking for what is unknown, but in knowing what is known. Only this can lead to effectual knowledge in the sense defined in the last chapter. This method is in some respects opposed to our customary habits of thought, whereby we suppose that it must be possible from the start to say clearly and finally anything that can be said at all. We are accustomed to regard repetition as a defect of exposition and to suppose that an experiment once made need not be repeated unless some doubt is cast upon its accuracy.

The method of progressive approximation consists in returning again and again to examine the same material of experience in order to search for new depths of meaning and to transform these meanings into understanding.

Facts make no demands upon us and values make a demand that we are powerless to satisfy; for the character of values is such that the realization of one must involve the sacrifice of another. Values and facts can be regarded as the affirming and denying elements that, unless reconciled, produce only the polar force of frustration and dissatisfaction. We may use the word meaning to designate that which reconciles fact and value, provided that we remember that this use requires that meanings should be associated rather with will than with consciousness or function. We must recognize also that this interpretation of the word 'meaning' implies that values in the absence of fact mean nothing. A world of pure value must collapse into a dream of unfulfilled potentialities, just as a world of unrelated fact could only be a dead world. Always and in everything there is a need to reconcile not only fact and value but one level of values with another. In the domain of fact there is incoherence; in that of values there is a conflict of loyalties. The discovery of meanings on each scale and every level [* Cf. D. Saurat, Death and the Dreamer and The Three Conventions (New York, 1926).] is the task of the understanding. The present use of the word 'meaning' is consistent with that adopted in Section 2.4.2. where it was defined as the recognition of a recurrent element in experience; for, as we shall see later, recurrence is characteristic of the reconciling element and recognition depends upon the combined action of value and fact.

This is why, as we have seen in the study of language, the communication of meanings is itself a triad in which the sign, the symbol, or the gesture serves to transmit the act of will.

We must be wary, however, when we set about circumscribing the field of our inquiry. By failure to pay attention to possible defects of language, we may overlook significant distinctions and so invalidate our findings. It may be easy to describe facts, for they lend themselves to classification in terms of observed regularities; but the very generality of some of our conclusions is deceptive, and we must understand why this should be so. The methods we commonly employ for dealing with facts are complicated, but on the whole they are successful.

He rarely succeeds in grasping the principle of uncertainty in physical measurement, and many years may pass before he realizes that all measurement demands a judgment on the compromise between accuracy and expediency.

When we pass from the general assessment of scientific data—that is, of facts—to the actual conduct of an experiment, we see that even the observation of phenomena is impossible without value judgments. A scientist wishes to establish facts and often claims that he does so without any judgment of value. This is self-deception, however, for success in scientific investigation depends upon choosing a field of experimentation likely to give interesting and 'valuable' results. Even when the experiment is decided upon and accurate observation becomes the principal aim of the worker, the separation between fact and value is still impossible—even in the very procedure that seeks to make it.

We attend to what interests us and, in attending, our state of consciousness changes. In a wider sense, value is discovered when we can stand aside from the data of immediate sense-experience and survey the whole scene against past and future events. In the highest sense of all value is experienced sub specie ceternitatis. For such a level of consciousness there is no separation of knowledge, judgment, and decision, and therefore it corresponds to the attainment of objective reason. Our ordinary consciousness can only separate fact and value to the extent of its limited powers; it sees the phenomenal world only, and even that incompletely.

Wholeness is relative. In our limited experiences we never find wholes that are perfectly integrated. Wholes are also structures, and we never find them complete. Because of imperfection and incompleteness, there is always an element of bewilderment in our attempts to make sense of the world about us. This bewilderment alternates with wonder and admiration as we discern beyond the immediate confusion the outlines of the universal pattern. The bewilderment and the wonder are equally valid elements in our experience; they are like the poles of a magnet that serve to orientate us towards understanding.

More recently, however, scientists have come to recognize that an uncritical attitude towards general principles is not only bad philosophy but bad science. They have realized that many universal principles that formerly were accepted as having universal validity have subsequently proved incompatible with observed facts. For example, the natural philosophers of the nineteenth century in no way questioned the principle of continuity—natura enim in suis oper-ationibus non facit saltum—which appeared to be experimentally established for ever by the work of Joule and Kelvin. Perhaps the greatest shock to the complacency of physical scientists came with Planck's demonstration that upon the atomic scale there is discontinuity —nature does, in fact, operate by jumps. The principle of uniformity— which likewise was taken for granted in the nineteenth century—led to the wild-goose chase after mechanistic explanations of all phenomena, including those of life and consciousness—a chase of which physicists and biologists alike have begun to weary.*

Newton's laws of motion were regarded as a foretaste of laws even simpler and even wider in their scope. There was in these centuries a strange disregard of the phenomenon of contingency and a consequent refusal to accept uncertainty as an element of fact. That science made great progress notwithstanding this refusal is due to an unconscious reliance upon the rule of universal similarity.

These examples are sufficient to show how widely the characteristic of universal similarity casts its net, and how it can serve to knit together many of the assumptions without which natural science could not work. When applied with due care—that is, having regard to what we find in our experience—the postulate of the homogeneity of fact and the rule of universal similarity can provide a solid basis for the unification of the sciences.

> The doctrine of levels of existence has been familiar to European thought since Aristotle constructed the first scale of being. The idea has been made explicit by MacTaggart in The Nature of Existence. He wrote: "If there are two varieties of thought of which one is higher and more comprehensive than the other, it will be impossible from the nature of the case for the lower and narrower to be directly aware that the higher is valid. From the very fact that the higher will have canons of thought not accepted by the lower, it must appear invalid to the latter, which can only be forced to accept it by external and indirect proof of its truth."

The laws that govern the relationship between strata are not wholly factual but involve relationships of value. Through the method of progressive approximation, however, it is possible to establish a general scale of existence in the first place, and thereafter to clarify the relationship between levels. Such clarification is mainly concerned with meanings, and it therefore goes beyond the strictly limited task of reducing phenomena to facts.

3.6.8. The Postulate of Complementarity The connection between the odd and the even numbered principles shows that neither series can be understood without reference to the others.++ We have seen an example of this in the need to bring into account both wholeness and polarity in order to formulate the postulate of the stratification of existence.

The ancient saying of Democritus, "The way up is the way down", can be restated as the postulate of complementarity, according to which it is, in everything, necessary to confront opposing views in order to arrive at meanings. We have already seen this in the relationship of fact and value. It appears in the realm of fact in the opposition of the dynamic and static aspects of experience formulated in the odd and even numbered categories.

Structure is indeed so fundamental that in our experience it is prior even to space and time. That this is so must be recognized if we are not to be misled by the great differences apparent in structures when they are seen from the perspective of temporal actualization. Events in time present various recognizable features. For example, there are conservative events, such as the persistence of a material object; there are cyclic events, such as the swinging of a pendulum; there are movements of expansion, such as the growth of an acorn to a tree, and there are the movements of concentration, such as the coiling of a spring.

Concentration is a process whereby a higher gradation of energy is selected by a given whole, and lower gradations are rejected. It is the essential pattern of life itself, but it also is present wherever there is the building up of potential energy in either organic or inorganic matter.

The peculiar feature of complementarity is that it is neither observable as a process nor unobservable as a potentiality. Such dyads as the particle and wave dualism of electrons and protons illustrate this peculiarity. Complementarity is the source of coherence by which the balance of existence is preserved. To express this property we shall adopt the term 'hyparxis', which is usually translated as 'subsistence' or 'existence', but which in its original meaning signified the ableness-to-be.+

> All the regularities of an universal character that do not depend upon any given gradation of wholeness can be called 'framework determining-conditions'. The chief characteristic of these conditions is that experience never fails to conform to them—at any rate, upon the level of phenomena accessible to our ordinary states of consciousness. Framework determining-conditions are, therefore, unlike scientific generalizations—which have only limited validity within a given stratum of existence; nor do they correspond to the regularities of existence—which are neither more nor less than the grouping of wholes according to the intensity of their inner-togetherness. The four determining-conditions, with their chief phenomenal characteristics, are shown in the following table: Determining-condition. Phenomenal Characteristic. Eternity. Potentiality and intensity of being. Time. Actualization and irreversibility. Hyparxis. Ableness-to-be and cyclicity. Space. Presence and co-existence. [[Quotes]] [[John Bennet]]

Again, if we say that it is impossible for water to run uphill, we are making an assertion the meaning of which is only clear with considerable knowledge of the physical world; but, when this meaning is grasped, it serves to tell us something of fundamental importance about the nature of time and existence. Nevertheless, a statement is neither meaningful nor true unless it is placed in the right context. For example, water in a siphon will run uphill—but only to a height of some thirty feet—whereas water forced into a pipe-line by a powerful pump will flow uphill to a very great height. In so far as we have knowledge of the physical world, we recognize the meaning of these statements, and also of the limits within which they are true or false.

We must note here the distinction also required between 'possible' and 'potential'. That which is potential exists no less than that which is actual. For example, we speak of potential and kinetic energy, and in doing so we imply both existence and the possibility of actualization. But when we speak of a possible event, we do not necessarily imply that the existential content required for subsequent actualization is present.

Thus 'possible' tells us that universal laws—such as those of logic and physics—are not violated; while 'potential' tells us that something exists in a non-actualized form. Moreover, we can readily see that what is potential must be possible, but what is possible is not necessarily potential.

True logic is the search for laws that determine the form of phenomena without reference to actualization in space and time, and without distinction of actual and potential. The laws of arithmetic have the same kind of significance as those of geometry and dynamics. All consist of propositions that have universal validity for phenomena, and are therefore implied in all statements about fact.

Kant rightly saw time as the form in which our inner state is intuited; but he discarded as irrelevant the tricks played upon our experience of time by modifications in our state of consciousness. We are subject both to illusion and hallucination, but these concern existence rather than the form of our experience.

The rule of excluded middle is valid only for propositions about wholes, and it amounts to a convention that whenever a whole is named it will be treated as though it were an individual. If we penetrate more deeply into our experience, we find ourselves ultimately confronted by complex structures with all their uncertainties and incompletenesses. We therefore can answer the question, 'Are there alternative logics ?' by saying that there are as many logics as there are fundamental categories of our experience. There is the two-term logic of wholes and polarity, the three-term logic of the triad, and so on.

All 'parts of speech' stand for things and attributes and processes. More rarely, and usually without fully recognizing their character, we use words to indicate levels of being. In the English language suffixes such as -hood, -ity, -ness often give some indication of being; as when we refer to 'thinghood', manhood', 'animality', 'deity', 'happiness', 'consciousness', and so on. 'Space' and 'hyparxis' are not words of either kind, for they signify neither what anything is nor what it does.* The former is the outer and the latter is the inner condition of 'being what one is'.

Repetition that can be expressed by the sentence 'It is still there' can be called 'conservative'. It is the renewal in time of the whole or wholes that present themselves in the total experience. Conservation is thus a limitation upon the arbitrariness of actualization. Wholes, generally speaking, are independent of states of consciousness—some are more so, some are less. They are also more or less independent of other wholes. From this follows the conservative character of their actualization.

(iv) Actualization is conservative and irreversible. (v) Every whole is actualized conservatively to the extent of its completeness.

It will be noted that the view of time herein adopted stands between Platonism—for which the actual is merely a copy of the eternal reality present in the idea—and Thomism—for which the actual is fully real because it is the manifestation of the will of God; it probably corresponds to the intention of both philosophers. The characteristics of time can be summarized as successiveness, endurance, continuity, conservation, and irreversibility.

We define eternity as the condition of potentiality. It is necessary to grasp, however, that potential existence and actual existence are both modes of being. This can readily be seen in the case of mechanical energy, the law of conservation for which asserts that the sum of the potential and kinetic energies of a system of bodies moving without constraint is a constant. The formula, though familiar, has far-reaching implications; for it can have no meaning unless potential energy and kinetic energy are accorded the same existential status.

'Are there, then, laws of potential existence corresponding to the laws of actual existence?' With the definition of eternity as potentiality in mind, we can say that the laws of eternity should in some way complement the laws of time, so that the two together determine the conditions of existence. If then actualization is the separation of selected occasions, we should expect potentiality to be the co-existence of unselected occasions. From this it follows that potentiality can be multi-valent since all the occasions that are potential in a given situation can exist side by side, although only one can be actualized.

Comparing the two series, we can recognize that it is possible to pass from one member of the eternal series to another without change of entropy. On the other hand, the change is neither conservative nor continuous. We have therefore a condition that is in all respects the reverse of what we find in temporal actualization. The temporal series is conservative and irreversible. The eternal series is non-conservative and reversible. If we regard the thermo-dynamical laws as expressing the nature of time, we shall require to reverse them, in order to prescribe the character of eternity.

The concept of virtue is related to the familiar thermo-dynamical concept of entropy*. Virtue can be derived from entropy by reversing the sign and introducing scale factors as, for example, where So is the ambient entropy at absolute zero and S1 is the entropy corresponding to the maximum availability. Since S is always less than S0 and greater than S1 for any actual process of energy exchange, J is a positive quantity, varying from one to nothing. A system with integral virtue has all its potentialities intact; one with zero virtue is in a state of thermo-dynamic equilibrium. By the definition, J varies with time, but for a given system at a given moment of time, J is the same at all levels in eternity.

These conclusions can once again be summarized as prolegomena to the enunciation of the laws of space, as follows: (i) Space is the determining-condition of presence. (ii) Every occasion is present.

(v) All wholes are present to one another. (vi) The common presence of two wholes determines a unique property, called an 'interval'. (vii) Every proper-presence is determined by magnitudes that can be grouped in three independent sets. This is called 'configuration'. (viii) Every proper-presence divides space into three parts; one part wholly within and one wholly without it. The third part, which is common to both, is called its 'surface'. [* Alexander, Space, Time and Deity, Vol. I, p. 97. + Wittgenstein, loc. cit., 2.014 2,0251.] (ix) A proper-presence, regarded without reference to inner distinction, is called a 'point'.

That which is actual ceases to be potential; that which is potential has no actuality. It is true that, owing to the relativity of being, the balance of the two states may vary, but virtuality is not an intermediate form of existence, but rather a measure of the ratio between the two opposing states. There is a polar opposition and not a relationship. We must, therefore, seek for a triad in which a third independent reconciling force will serve to establish a relationship.

As elements in a triad, potentiality must be the affirming and actualization the denying force. Potentiality is the affirmation of a set of possible events—it is the pattern inherent in a given situation—whereas actualization is rejection of potentialities—the denial of the significance of the pattern as a totality in order to permit one of its facets to become actual. Actualization is a perpetual perishing, and because men have been aware of this they have doubted the ultimate reality of time.

Referring to the triad value—fact—meaning, we can appropriately relate value to eternity, fact to time, and meaning to hyparxis. An essential characteristic of a meaning is that it can be recognized. A value experienced once can be none the less valid even though it is not related to any other values. Although facts can be classified and their common features made the subject of scientific generalizations, it nevertheless remains true that each fact is unique and unrepeatable. Values are what they are, once and for all; they do not perish, but they do not return. Facts perish, and they also do not return. Therefore the property of return and recognition must derive from hyparxis. Hence we can say that in the same way as potentiality is the chief characteristic of eternity and actualization that of time, so is recurrence the chief characteristic of hyparxis. It is through recurrence that we recognize meanings. The science of pure meaning is logic which is independent of both fact and value.

The possibility of separating meanings from facts and values shows us how hyparxis is an independent determining-condition of possible experience. Its contribution consists in prescribing the extent to which any given whole is able to be itself. A bare actualization is the end of existence, a bare potentiality is its beginning. Between the two in some way the existence achieves a certain measure of fullness.

We extend our knowledge of this world by reducing phenomena to facts.

Language itself, however, is relative to being, and we have seen that the highest truths can be expressed only in the unique language of gesture. When these truths are, step by step, translated into the medium of common speech, it is inevitable that conventional and artificial ideas should be introduced that have the effect of obscuring the deeper meanings. Hence it is not possible to reduce revelation and knowledge of fact to any common denominator, either in experience or in language. Therefore, if an harmonious, unified structure is ever to emerge, we must endeavour to penetrate to the total experience of function, being, and will.

Potency is the assembly of potentialities within a given whole. It represents the limits of possible self-realization that are prescribed by a given class of wholeness. The richer and more significant the pattern of potentialities, the higher the level of being the given whole can attain. It must be emphasized that potency is not mandatory but permissive. No law requires that a given whole should realize its potentialities. Self-realization depends, not upon potency but upon ableness-to-be; that is upon an hyparchic, rather than an eternal, characteristic.

We are thus led to regard potency as the true basis of classification, by which entities are assigned to a given level of existence. Potency is not to be identified with being; it is, however, one element of being, namely that which affirms the pattern of existence. It thus stands in opposition to the actuality which, though the visible expression of the pattern, is nevertheless a denial in so far as it arises by the rejection of unfulfilled potentialities. The individuality of a given whole depends upon the manner in which that particular whole succeeds in reconciling the conflict of time and eternity.

By reason of potency, all experience is stratified and the potency of the phenomena can be disclosed by abstraction of non-essential details. The method of legitimate abstraction is thus applicable to all phenomena. That this is so does not mean that we have any direct perception of the potency by which different gradations of wholeness are characterized. We observe a certain pattern of external behaviour, and from this we infer that a corresponding whole is present. The inference could not be made from knowledge of behaviour alone, but requires a certain intuition of being. This is not a mystical intuition, but a sensitivity to potency such as that which brings the rocks to life for a good geologist. We have not only to recognize distinct behaviour-patterns but must also strive to relate them to our own intuitions of being and will. This striving is the process of hypothesis-formation, by which the natural scientist extends the frontiers of his knowledge.

There is, however, no more one astronomy than there is one biology. We should separate heliology and planetology, as we separate zoology and botany. Because this is not done, we miss the extraordinary problem that confronts us in trying to understand a level of being in which life as we know it could play no part and yet which, by reason of its greatness and its power over our own and all planetary existence, must be regarded as standing upon a higher level than our human consciousness can reach.

It is commonly overlooked that without the affirmation of a natural order the words 'possible' and 'impossible' can have no meaning. Our aim as natural philosophers is not to explain events but to formulate the rules that enable the possible to be distinguished from the impossible. Only when this has been done can we relate, in a recognizably consistent manner, the present moment—with its fleeting and seemingly capricious actualization—to other moments of experience remote in time and place.

In a world governed solely by self-consistent and inexorable laws, the simplest question could not be answered, nor even asked. Questions arise precisely because order is not all, but they can be answered only in so far as order is omnipresent. We certainly do ask questions and we do expect to find answers. Therefore all our philosophic activity rests upon the conviction that order and disorder are somehow interwoven in the stuff of reality. If the universe were divided into two parts—one orderly and one disorderly—the two parts could have no connection, and neither could be the dwelling-place of man. We must therefore conclude that order and disorder are inseparable.

Philosophers have disputed as to the relationship between appearance and reality—the idealists condemning all that is temporal as 'mere appearance' and regarding only the timeless, eternal Absolute as 'real'. This kind of idealism does not satisfy us, but the realism that treats phenomena as objective reality does not convince. We cannot believe that reality is wholly subjective, but equally we cannot admit that it is wholly objective. There can be no division of reality into two realms, one subjective and the other objective, one all experience and the other altogether devoid of experience. All that we have discovered in the first part of our studies must convince us that any such dichotomy is spurious. The dualism that seeks to retain both views without also seeking to reconcile them is unfruitful, and the pluralism that regards multiplicity as ultimate is a confession of failure. Even the triad consciousness-function-will, taken alone, does not account for the different degrees to which the three elements are fused in various kinds of situations. The universe, as it subsists, extends throughout many such degrees or levels, so that all experience can be represented by a triangular pyramid, with unity at its apex and multiplicity at its base.

The symbol dfds is used in determining the path traced by any body moving conservatively in a field of force, but it does not tell us either what the body is, or what motion is—nor does it describe any event. Consideration of such symbols must convince us that mathematics is concerned solely with distinguishing possible and impossible operations and processes. The connection may not always be self-evident, but it can always be discovered if we seek to understand the meaning of the symbol or operation without reference to any specific fact.

In a more general sense, it can be regarded as the science of representation, without any restriction to space-like relationships only. It is, for example, now customary to speak of a four-dimensional geometry of space-time, and even of N-dimensional geometries of unspecified character.

The mathematical language requires the use of numbers, and the question arises as to the degree of independence that is necessary between different sets of numbers in order to give an adequate representation of an event. An independent set of numbers is called a dimension, and a collection of such sets is what we have called a manifold. One of the tasks of the framework sciences is to determine the most appropriate manifold for the representation of all hyponomic entities. Every whole is—in respect of its simple wholeness—a unit indistinguishable from any other unit and, therefore, can be represented by the number one. Since, however, it is knowable in other respects, an array of numbers will be required to represent the various situations into which it can enter.

The ableness-to-be of a given whole, A, can be assessed only when it is confronted with other wholes B, C, D, etc., with which it may interact. In so far as all its interactions can be disregarded, a whole can be treated as if it were stationary in hyparxis—and the geometry then reduces to the five-dimensional scheme of time, eternity, and space.
