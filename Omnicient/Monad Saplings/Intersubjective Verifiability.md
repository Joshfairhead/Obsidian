# Intersubjective Verifiability
**Intersubjective verifiability** is the capacity of a concept to be readily and accurately communicated between different individuals ("intersubjectively, and to be reproduced "Reproducibility") under varying circumstances for the purposes of verification. It is a core principle of empirical, scientific "Science") investigation.
