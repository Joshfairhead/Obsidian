# Logic

## Logic: A Science Primer - [[Prof. Jevons]]

Two forms of reasoning are introduced
- Inductive
- Deductive

Reason is the act of gaining knowlege from other knowlege

### Deductive reasoning
3: All *mushrooms* are **good to eat** 
6: This fungus is a *mushroom*
9: Therefore this fungus is **good to eat**.

The above is a syllogism or an argument.
The argument or syllogism above consists of three propositions. 
When we join propositions like this we are reasoning.

There are three ingredients to deductive logic:
- Proposition 
- Terms
- Syllogism

Note that all three terms are also used twice.
- Mushrooms
- Fungus
- Good to eat

Also note that each proposition is of a different modality. It therefore seems to me that there is a hidden ennegram at play. Theres probably a way to state this logically. 

#### Terms
**Terms are more than just names.** They can consist of any number of nouns, substatives or adjectives, with articles, prepositions and the conjunctions required to join them. **They connect things together in singulatity** as a single object, collection or class of objects.

- 3: **Singular terms**; "British museum", "Pompeis Pillar" are names of single things.
- 6: **General terms**; are the most common and refer to conceptually fungible things that are seperate from all other things. e.g. Shillings, Tokens, Cups, Chairs. 
- 9: **Collective terms**; are terms that collect conceptually non-fungible things together creating a whole from other wholes. E.g. Europe.

Don't confuse General terms with Collective terms; they are of different qualityies.

Terms can be **concrete** or **abstract**. 
- **Concrete terms** are most terms that can be put in plural: house, mountain, slate.
- **Abstract terms** are qualities, properties or accidents that belong to things: magnitude of a house, elevation of a mountain, colour of slate, thickness of a phone, etc.

**Perfectly abstract terms cannot be plural**. Pluralised abstractions are necesserily conjoined to the concrete: e.g. Colour(s) of a house. Colours is an (imperfectly) abstract term. House is a concrete term. 

Terms can be **positive** or **abstract**.
- Generally we give names to things due to a particular quality
- In other cases we give names to things due to a lack of a particular quality
	- For example: un-, a-, an-, im-, non-, or -less.
- Some terms break from and substitute for these conventions.
	- "immaleable" is weird and often "brittle" is substituted
	- Transparent/opaque
	- True/false
	- Dry/moist
	- Rough/smooth
	- Verse/prose
- **Some distinctions commit fallicies** as they are not the true negatives of eachother. The negative of big is not small; its not-big. Big and small require mediation through some reference. Hot is the posession of more heat than a median. Cold is the posession of less heat than a median.
	- Large/Small
	- Light/Dark
	- Hot/Cold
	- Heavy/Light
	
### Full meaning of terms

A concrete term has two distinctions:
- The things to which the term applies (i.e. a singular house in the class of houses)
- The qualities of those things in consequence of which its applied (i.e. the smoothness of the wall)

Every general term has two meanings:
- The things to which the terms **applied** (e.g. particular ships)
- The qualities as implied as being in the things

The number of things to which a term is applied is the **extension** of the term.
The qualities that are implied are the **intension**

This balance is non-dual and varies in degree. They can be scoped with prefix (e.g. steam-ship).
"Steam-ship" has greater **intension** but less **extension**.

### The correct use of words
> In endevourisg to use words correctly there is nothing more necessary than to use words with care. [[Quotes]]

> The meaning of a word is that thing in which we think about when we use a word. [[Quotes]] %% Better phrased as significance?? %%

We should thus be careful of ambiguity and seek to reduce it. 

### How and why we classify things
> We class things together whenever we observe that they are alike in any respect, and thereofre think of them together. [[Quotes]]

> There is nothing more useful thon to be able to classify things correctly and easily, so as to form general notions about them. [[Quotes]]

> So far as things are exactly alike, whatever is true of one thing will be true of the others, which so resemble eachother. When we classify things correctly we ascertain the exact nature and degree of their resemlences and record the information we have gained in the briefest and most convinient form. [[Quotes]] [[Extitutionality]]^600f38

Accidents are irregular properties, and specific to instanstiations of the class. 
Properties are common to all things within a class.

> In classifying a collection of objects we do not meerrly put together into groups those which resemble eachother, but we also divide each larger class into smaller ones in which the resemblence is comblete (e.g. White -> Liquids/Solids)

- **Genus** is the superset (e.g. "rectileanear figures")
- **Species** is the subset (e.g. "three sided rectileanear figures")

Often dividing a genus into species results in logical blunders due to overlap

> These difficulties are avoided in the perfect logical method of dividing each genus into two species, and not more than two - so that one species posesses a particular quality and the other not. 

**Wrong:**
Dwelling-house
- Brick
- Stone 
- Earth
- Iron

**Right**
Dwelling-house
- Brick
- Not Brick
	- Stone
	- Not Stone
		- Wooden
		- Not Wooden
			- Iorn
			- Not Iron

- Species thus has a **narrower extension** than Genus: less meanning due to scope (quantity)
- Species thus has a **greater intension** than genus: more meaning due to greater precision (quality)

The quality by which a genus is divided into two or more species is called the **difference** (delta)

> By a definiton we wean a precise statement of the qualities, which are just sufficient to mark out a class. We must not suppose for a moment that all qualities of a thing are to be included in a class.[[Quotes]] [[Information Theory]]

- Redness is a quality that will be no part of the definition of a brick-dwelling-house but will be said to be an **accident of the species**. (e.g. Platypus is a mamal that lays eggs)
- An **accident** thus means a quality that may or may not belong to a class (accidenty as it were).
- Qualities that belong to a class but are not regarded as part of its definition are called **properties** 

**Quality:**
- Property
- Accident

### Propositions 
"Coins are metallic" ([[Propositions Triad]])
- Coins: **Subject** of the proposition
- Are: **Coupla**
- Metallic: **Predicate** or that which is affirmed

A **subject** is the name of a thing, or class of things contained among the more numerous things - of which the **predicate** is the name. (e.g. Josh is human; subject, coupla, predicate). Therefore a predicate is the **class** of which an instation comes from. More concretely; I must be a human to be a Josh!

- Propositions can be **negative**: the rocks NOT flammible (the rocks are not of the class flammible).
- Propositions can be **hypothetical**: if the stoves on, it will scald you.
- Propositions can be **disjunctive**: lightning can be sheet or forked

Propostitions can also differ in the **quantity of proportion** since they can be universal or perticular.
- **Universal**: All clouds are made of particals
- **Particular**: That cloud is dark

There are four base types of propositon:
- Universal affirmitive
- Universal negative
- Particular affirmitive
- Particular negative

When a term is universally affirmed, it is only the subject (coins) that is distributed. The predicate (metal) remains singular. 

"No seaweed is a flowering plant": Universal negative.
- Subject is distributed as before
- Predicate is distributed
	- You would have to check all plants to make such an assertion!

**This is an important truth.**
> The universal negative proposition distributes both its subject and its predicate. ~[[Quotes]] p44
- A particular affirmitive proposition distributes neither its subjcet nor its predicate ("that coin is metallic").
- A particular negative proposition "some violets are not odorous"
	- The subject is undistributed (violets) but the predictate is distributed. 
- When we say "some violets are odorous", the propostition is both an affirmation and negation: "Some violets are odorous; Some violets are not odorous"

## Changing propositions
**Proposition conversion**
Universal affirmitive propositions can be transformed into a universal negative of the same meaning: e.g. "There are no things which may not be useful" = "All things may be useful" 

**Simple conversion:** "Some churches are wooden" = "Some wooden buildings are churches"

A particular affirmitive proposition can be simply converted. 
Such is the case with universal negative propositions. 

Universal affirmitive propositions are harder to convert however:
- "All jellyfish are animals" - True
- "All animals are jellyfish" - False

The proposition of the negative should be: 
- "All jellyfish are some animals" - True
- "Some animals are all jellyfish" - **Limited conversion**

A universal **affirmitive propostion** when so converted becomes a **particular affirmitive** one = **Limited conversion**

## Syllogism 
In a great many of the arguments we use, on proposition is gathered or inferred from two other propositions:
