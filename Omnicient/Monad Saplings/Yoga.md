## Sun Salutations
It is a sequence of postures or asanas that aims to awaken the body physically, mentally, and energetically. It is often performed in the morning facing the sunrise, but it can be done at any time of day. The movements flow together fluidly and bring awareness to the entire body. Physically, it targets just about every part of the body so that you're prepared for a longer practice involving more poses.
