            - (What) Using state of the art technologies to manage assets and value flows within our network, we are able to offer low risk investments and stable returns while delivering sustainable abundance to all of humanity.
            - (How) We enable any investor to retrieve accurate information about goods, arming society with the same statistical process control techniques which revolutionized manufacturing and investment to completely transform consumption on a global scale.
            - What (mechanism)
                - True Value [[Securities]]: 
                    - Stable returns via 
                    - Low risk investment vehicle

                        - Reduced ESG risks
                            - **ESG risks** include those related to climate change impacts mitigation and adaptation, environmental management practices and duty of care, working and safety condition, respect for human rights, anti-bribery and corruption practices, and compliance to relevant laws and regulations
            - How (example)
                - REA accounting
                - Circularisation of resources.
                    - As the assets improve in value, it generates value for the network as a whole.
                    - The networks purpose is to improve the value of its assets
                    - The network autonomously produces assets relevant to its structural requirements, minimising costs.
                    - By utilising and combining the networks excess resources, its assets appreciate in value.
                    - This occurs through aggregation and regeneration at marginal cost or true price. 
                    - Improving the value of networked assets to improve the value of the network.
                - we turn ne participations into [[Securities]].
                - Anti-fragility. As regenerated places "leave" the network by being sold, the network obtain rewards and can move resources and focus on regenerating new places.
                - Assets are added to the network
            - Social Proof -  We have multiple membranes across the globe.
