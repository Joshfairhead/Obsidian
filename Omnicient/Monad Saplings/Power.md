[The Problem With Human Rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhRBsJYWR8Q). In a nutshell: human rights are given from an authority in power - the ruling class, king or those with a monopoly on power. For those in such an authoritive position, they get to decide whos interests are represented. They can grant or retract rights from those they have an asymetry over (working class) unless this class themselves steps into their agency and effectivly challenges them. "We all have the same rights under god, I'm just carrying out his will" being the rhetoric used by kings. "We all have the same rights under the constitution, we're just enforcing them."
