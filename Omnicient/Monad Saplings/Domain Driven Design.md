# Domain Driven Design

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)

**Domain-driven design** (**DDD**) is the concept that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes such as LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.

DDD connects the Implementation to an evolving model.
Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

-   placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;
-   basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
-   initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

The term was coined by Eric Evans in his book of the same title.
