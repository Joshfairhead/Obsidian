## On the Nature of Human Assembly ~[[Forrest Landry]] 
![](assets/OnTheNatureOfHumanAssembly.pdf)

### Three organising principals:
- Democracy
- Meritocracy
- Consensus

**Democracy**; a range of possible options is reviewed, discussion and persuasion ([[Rhetoric]]) is followed by a vote, and the majority decision applies to the whole

**Meritocracy**; some process (doesn't matter which) is used to select a focus of decision making (a single person or group), which then (perhaps after listening to the considered council of others) will make a decision applied to the whole. It is assumed that the whole will alvays and implicitly trust the part to make decisions 'correctly' (what ever that notion is taken to mean by the group)

**Consensus**; all members sit in council together and discuss potential decisions together until a complete and total agreement is reached among members (however long it takes) which then becomes the decision of the group

### Transition dynamic
> in effect there needs to be a natural means for a group to transition from "being to doing" and then transition back from "doing to being"
- "Is"; the internal group processes
- "Does"; external group interacitons

Consensus used for organisational and planning aspects for the group (Omnicient modality). Merit for the basis of operation during actual group action (Executing a plan: immanent modality). Democracy for the moderation of the transition between consensus and meritocracy (Trancedental modality).

In the event of the selected focus person going too far or an emotional disagreement between members of the group and consensus not being reached the democratic process would be used to moderate or suspend the other two forms of decision making (consensus or meritocracy).

#### Compact statement of protocol
**Consensus process**, which is based on the total and hearttfelt agreement of all members of the group, is used to make 1) all of the important decisions about the being, nature, and intent of the group and its actions, and 2) selecting single individuals to act as a coordinating and decision making focus of each particular action, and the group member who will be responsible for facillitating the next consensus decision making meeting of the group (note different people may be chosen for each role).

**Executive process**, which is based only on the merit and authority of the selected focus person, is used to make decisions about 1) the implementation of a specifc group external action, and 2) how to best enable the consensus decision making process during a group meeting. 

**Democratic process**, which is based on a spontaneous majority vote of those present in any gathering of the group, is used to make only two kinds of decisions: 1) whether to immediately suspend the currently pending executive process (i.e., to indefinitely suspend the authority of the currently acting focus person) and return directly to a consensus decision making process, and 2) whether to immediatly suspend the currently pending consus decision making process, with respect to a particular stalled decision. (Note; in effect, the latter aspect is a transition to a type of executive process, usually to select a focus person who will ensure that the issue is taken up at some (other) future scheduled meeting, or suspended by vote again, if the situation warrants. It is important to let the stalled decision rest for the remainder of the current meeting, so that other issues can be discussed if needed).
