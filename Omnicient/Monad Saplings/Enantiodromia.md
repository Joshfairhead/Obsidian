# Enantiodromia

### Wikipedia
> **Enantiodromia** is a principle introduced in the West by psychiatrist Carl Jung. In "Psychological Types", Jung defines enantiodromia as "the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time. It is similar to the principle of (reflective) equilibrium in the natural world, in that any extreme is opposed by the system in order to restore balance. When things get to their extreme, they turn into their opposite. Jung adds that "this characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, one-sided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control."
> 
> However, in Jungian terms, a thing psychically transmogrifies into its shadow opposite, in the repression of psychic forces that are thereby cathected into something powerful and threatening.
> 
> This principle was explicitly understood and discussed in the principles of traditional Chinese religion, as in Taoism and yin-yang. A central premise of the I Ching is that yang lines become yin when they have reached their extreme, and vice versa.

- **Animism**
	- Came first
- **Jews**
	- Set themselves up in response to paganic animistic traditions
	- Steralizes the senses in a proto intelecutal way
	- Deleuzeian war machine bringing their alphabet 
	- Projected deities into the worlds they wished to explore
	- Devine insight was really a result of a rearranged symbol set

- **Now**  
	- > We are frustrated Voyers
	- Everything in modern myth has been constructied from a Voyeristic (or Omnicient) perspective. This is perhaps symptomatic of a long lost trauma at the dawn of humanity. %% Note that this is relativly consistent with Graves Theory and the move out of AN>BO - food dries up or something happened that made us think ahead and anticipate. AN modalities are essentially autistic and content not thinking ahead because there is abundance. However it seems more likely that whats being referred to is actually the CP>DQ move as were talking about religion. Therefore not everything in modern myth is voyeristic, just the deny self conceptions%% 
	- 1:09:00 - Territorialising the brain through over excited neurons, the arisal of ego through intergenerational trauma. Literal scarification patterns from over exictement passed down intergenerationaly. Sudden reorganisations break down these walls. LSD lowers the threshold at which these reorganisations happen.
	- > The technological unconscious.
	- Terriotoralisation of the brain is made up by deamons, symbols are code that refers to a constellation of these territories. Symbolisation thus becomes more complex as we break down these boundries as we need ways to talk about the boundaries of our territorialisation.
