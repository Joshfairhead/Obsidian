[The knowlege podcast 109](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/nir-eyal/)

| Essence | Existance |
|---|---|
| Internal Trigers | External triggers |
| Distraction | Traction |

### Field of Action (NOT distraction)
- Mastering internal triggers. 10 min rule; give in after 10 min if you like. 
	- Go back to what you were doing OR sit with sensations and explore them.
- Making time for traction. Know what you want so you can define what your being distracted from.
	- Time and place to do things grounds them in action
- Manage external triggers. hack them back.
	- Minimise the imperatives and contingency around you
- Prevent distraction with pre commitments 
	- Timers, Bets, etc.

### Creating time for traction
- **You**
	- Attributes of the person you want to become; how much time would they spend doing things
- **Relationships**
	- Attributes of the social life you want to have; how much is needed.
- **Working time**
	- Reflective (time to think)
	- Reactive (mails, twitter etc.)

**Schedule sync**
Avoid being micromanaged, show template for the day. Then show the list of entropy. Ask if theres anything that needs to be reprioritised.
