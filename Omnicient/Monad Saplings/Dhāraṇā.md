# Dhāraṇā
[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dh%C4%81ra%E1%B9%87%C4%81)

_**Dhāraṇā**_ (from Sanskrit धारणा) is translated as "collection or concentration of the mind (joined with the retention of breath)", or "the act of holding, bearing, wearing, supporting, maintaining, retaining, keeping back (in remembrance), a good memory", or "firmness, steadfastness, certainty". This term is related to the verbal Sanskrit roots _dha_ and _ana,_ to hold, carry, maintain, resolve. Dharana is the noun.

_Dhāraṇā_ is the sixth limb of eight elucidated by Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga or Raja Yoga in his _Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
