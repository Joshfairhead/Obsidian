# Designing Decentralized Knowledge Management Systems to Effectuate Individual and Collective Generative Capacities

Appropriately, Levy not only envisages the decentralizing KM revolution but also stresses the need for the “sustainable growth of autonomous capacities in PKM” as “one of the most important functions of teaching” as well as the “need for a personal discipline for collection, filtering and creative Decentralized knowledge management connection (among data, among people, and between people and data flows)” 

For survival, memes:

Either need to be encoded in inanimate durable world:1 vectors (such as buildings, machines, products, software, storage devices, books, great art, or major myths) spreading at times unchanged for millennia, or to succeed in competing for a living host’s world:2 limited attention span (such as people, teams, corporations, or economies) to be [subjectively and tacitly] memorized (internalization) until forgotten, codified (externalization) in further [concrete] world:1 objects [(via objective abstract world:3 objects)] or spread by the spoken word to other hosts’ world:2 brains (socialization) with the potential to mutate into new variants or form symbiotic relationships (combination) with other memes (memeplexes) to mutually support each other’s fitness and to replicate together (Schmitt, 2018b).

Lane’s five agent characteristics (Figure 1, right column) exemplify such a qualification focusing on relational generative potentials (Lane, 2011, pp. 10-12). Other relevant kind of ties identified by network research include "communication ties (such as who talks to whom, or who gives information or advice to whom), formal ties (such as who reports to whom), affective ties (such as who likes whom, or who trusts whom), material or work flow ties (such as who gives money or other resources to whom), proximity ties (who is spatially or electronically close to whom) and cognitive ties (such as who knows who knows whom). Networks are typically multiplex, that is, actors share more than one type of tie” (Katz et al., 2004, p. 308). Using the PKMS’s functionalities to craft and nurture one’s social capital and regenerative relationships in such conscious ways is promising returns in terms of access or mobilization.
