## Quotes

> Improving your discovery process should come after regaining your ability to ship.

> We reduce risk in the shaping process by solving open questions _before_ we commit the project to a time box. We don’t give a project to a team that still has rabbit holes or tangled interdependencies.
> 
> We reduce risk in the planning process by capping our bets to six weeks. If a project runs over, by default it doesn’t get an extension. This “circuit breaker” ensures that we don’t invest multiples of the original appetite on a concept that needs rethinking first.

> And lastly we reduce risk in the building process by integrating design and programming early. Instead of building lots of disconnected parts and hoping they’ll fit together in the 11th hour, we build one meaningful piece of the work end-to-end early on and then repeat. The team sequences the work from the most unknown to the least worrisome pieces and learns what works and what doesn’t by integrating as soon as possible.

> Over-specifying the design also leads to estimation errors. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the more specific the work is, the harder it can be to estimate. That’s because making the interface _just so_ can require solving hidden complexities and implementation details that weren’t visible in the mockup.

> Concerning estimation, under-specified projects naturally grow out of control because there’s no boundary to define what’s out of scope.

> Property 1: It’s rough
> - Work in the shaping stage is rough. Everyone can tell by looking at it that it’s unfinished. They can see the open spaces where their contributions will go. Work that’s too fine, too early commits everyone to the wrong details. Designers and programmers need room to apply their own judgement and expertise when they roll up their sleeves and discover all the real trade-offs that emerge.
> 
> Property 2: It’s solved
> - The work isn’t specified down to individual tasks, but the overall solution is spelled out. While surprises might still happen and icebergs could still emerge, there is clear direction showing what to do
> 
> Property 3: It’s bounded
> - Lastly, shaped work indicates what _not_ to do. It tells the team where to stop. There’s a specific appetite—the amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within that fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving specific things out.
>
> Taken together, the roughness leaves room for the team to resolve all the details, while the solution and boundaries act like guard rails. They reduce risk and channel the team’s efforts, making sure they don’t build too much, wander around, or get stuck.

> ## Steps to shaping
> 1.  **Set boundaries.** First we figure out how much time the raw idea is worth and how to define the problem. This gives us the basic boundaries to shape into.
> 2.  **Rough out the elements.** Then comes the creative work of sketching a solution. We do this at a higher level of abstraction than wireframes in order to move fast and explore a wide enough range of possibilities. The output of this step is an idea that solves the problem within the appetite but without all the fine details worked out.
> 3.  **Address risks and rabbit holes.** Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered questions that could trip up the team. We amend the solution, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain tricky spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time.
> 4.  **Write the pitch**. Once we think we’ve shaped it enough to potentially bet on, we package it with a formal write-up called a `pitch`. The pitch summarizes the problem, constraints, solution, rabbit holes, and limitations. The pitch goes to the `betting table` for consideration. If the project gets chosen, the pitch can be re-used at kick-off to explain the project to the team.
