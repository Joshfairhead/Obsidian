# Astropoiesis

 I've been thinking about Landrys metaphysics and the immanent the nature of life (in the triadic context of alive, vital, creative) and synthesised a new word last night; `Astropoiesis`. 
 
 I'm defining `Astropoiesis` as the Immanent rate of change in relation to becoming and being. The speed at which universe unfolds or the speed at which molecules/atoms etc reconfigure themselves in order for us to move through time/space/the quantum fabric. 
 
 Reasoning through a lens that prioritises the [[Immanent]], the faster the rate of change the more alive something is. The universe in creation - or the present moment - being the fastest rate of change I can possibly imagine. It seems deeply connected with infinity. The present moment in is Immanent in creation. Relating this to the aliveness of an individual there are three derrivable qulities; **doing, becoming and being**. 
 
 Repeat the mantra: "I am therefore I do, I do therefore I become, I become therefore I am".

Now in relation to orgs and my experience with blitzscaling at Pillar, it was similar to Peters one, it took a toll due to the rate of change. Why? I think it was a case of my own `Astropoietic` rate in relation to the immnent reality, how quickly I was transforming vs the organisation as whole. An org 'capacity' mismatch in aliveness. 

the org was more alive than the individual and thus incomprehensible. 

Note that there are qualities involved in `Astropoiesis` though, it's not just rate of change that is indicative of life, which from the [[Immanent]] modal attractor, but there are three derrivable qualities. There are the qualities of **doing, becoming** and **being**. If you once again prioritiese the [[Immanent]], then you want to double down on the doing but it goes round in the following triad (starting from the [[Trancendental]]): "I am therefore I do, I do therefore I become, I become therefore I am".
